NO.\\n1021 of 1973.\\nM.S. Gujral, R.N. Poddar and Dalveer Bhandari for the appellant.\\nU.R. Lalit, N.M. Ghatate and S.V. Deshpande for the Respondent.\\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by SEN, J.\\nThis appeal by special leave directed against the judgment and order of a Division Bench of the Bombay High Court at Nagpur dated October 27, 1980 raises a questions to whether a staff car of the Technical Advisor to the North Chirimiri Collieries owned by respondent No. 1, the United Collieries Limited, which was nationalized under sub s.(l) of s.3 of the Coal Mines (Nationalization) Act, 1973 w.e.f.\\nMay 1, 1973, was or was not covered by the definition of the term 'mine ' in s.2(h)(xii) and therefore stood transferred to, and became vested in, the Central Government free from all encumbrances.\\nIt is common ground that the Ambassador car No. MHX 3771 was purchased by Messrs Karamchand Thapar & Bros. (Coal Sales) Ltd., Delhi in the year 1966 and was transferred to respondent No. 1, United Collieries Limited, the owners in relation to the North Chirmiri Collieries, and it was therefore the owner of the said vehicle.\\nOn and from the appointed day i.e. May 1, 1973, the right, title, and interest of the owners in relation to the coal mines specified in the Schedule stood transferred to, and became vested absolutely in, the Central Government free from all encumbrances, under sub s.(1) of s.3 of the Act.\\nIt is also not in dispute that the vehicle had been placed at the disposal of one D.D. Diddi, the Technical Advisor to the North Chirimiri Collieries to be used as his staff car.\\nImmediately after the nationalization of the coal mines, the Deputy Custodian General, Coal Mines Authority Limited, Nagpur addressed a letter dated May 9, 1973 to the aforesaid D. D. Diddi requiring him to hand over the staff car to the Custodian.\\nIn his reply dated May 25, 1973, he asserted that although the said car belonged to respondent No. 1 and had been allotted to him for use as a staff car, it was not used exclusively for the North Chirimiri Collieries but used by him for looking after the multifarious activities of the Thapar Group of Industries which 212 was a composite concern with businesses other than coal mining.\\nIt is not necessary for us to refer to the long correspondence that A ensued between the parties.\\nEventually, the Managing Director, Western Division, Coal Mines Authority Ltd., Nagpur addressed letters dated August 9, 1973 both to respondent No. 1 and the erstwhile Technical Advisor stating that on coming into force of the Act the right, title and interest of the North Chirimiri Collieries vested in the Central Government under sub s.(1) of s.3 of the Act and therefore the car which was an asset belonging to the mine vested in the Central Government It further stated that if they failed to hand over possession of the car, they would he liable to prosecution under the Act.\\nThereupon respondent No. 1, United Collieries Limited, the owners of the coal mine, and the aforesaid D.D. Diddi, the erstwhile Technical Advisor of the North Chirimiri Collieries.\\nfiled a petition under article 226 of the Constitution before the Nagpur Bench of the High Court.\\nThe High Court held that the question as to whether the staff car should be treated as belonging to the owner of a mine as part of the mine itself raised disputed questions of fact relating to its user which would have to be determined on the basis of evidence.\\nIn taking that view, the High Court purported to rely upon the decision of this Court in New Satgram Engineering Works & Anr.\\nvs Union of India & Ors.(l) and left the parties to have their rights adjudicated in a civil suit.\\nIt accordingly discharged the rule directing respondent No. I to establish its claim by filing a civil suit with a direction that in the event of such a suit being filed, the Civil Court will consider the making of an appropriate order for the grant of interim relief on condition of furnishing of adequate P security keeping in view that the Coal Mines Authority had been deprived of the staff car for all these years.\\nWe are afraid, the judgment of the High Court cannot be sustained.\\nIt failed to appreciate that in dealing with the question whether or not staff car was covered by the definition of 'mine ' in s.2(h)(xii) the nature of its user was immaterial.\\nUndoubtedly, the staff car belonged to respondent No. 1, the United Collieries Ltd., the owners in relation to the mine, and it being the staff car of the Technical Advisor of the North Chirimiri Collieries, was an asset belonging to the mine.\\nThe High Court should therefore have (1) ; 213 answered the question in favour of the appellants and dismissed the writ petition on merits.\\nInstead it misdirected itself into thinking A that the matter was covered by the decision of this Court in New Satgram Engineering works ' case, supra, where it was observed that where there is a dispute as to whether a particular property vests in the Central Government or not under sub s.(l) of s.3 of the Act, the dispute undoubtedly is a civil dispute and must therefore be resolved by a suit.\\nThese observations of the Court in New Satgram Engineering Work.s ' case were made in the context of s.2(h)(xi).\\nIn the Act, 'mine ' in s.2(h) is defined, except what is immaterial, in the following terms: \\\"2.\\nDefinitions In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires, (h) 'mine ' means any excavation where any operation for the purpose of searching for the obtaining minerals has been or is being carried on.\\nand includes (vi) all lands, buildings, works, adits, levels, planes, machinery and equipments, instruments, stores, vehicles railways, tramways and siding in, or adjacent to a mine and used for the purposes of the mine, (xi) all lands and buildings other than those referred to in sub clause (x), wherever situated, if solely used for the location of the management, sale or liaison offices, or for the residence of officers and staff, of the mine; (xii) all other fixed assets, movable and immovable, belonging to the owner of a mine, wherever situated, and current assets, belonging to a mine, whether within its premises or outside.\\n\\\" It will be seen that there is difference in the language used in s.2(h)(xi) and (xii).\\nSub cl.\\n(xi) uses the words 'if solely used ' in relation to lands and buildings for the location of the management sale or liaison offices, or for the residence of officers and staff, or the mine, while sub cl.(xii) uses the words 'belonging to the owner of a mine, wherever situated '.\\nThe difference in language between the two expression 'if solely used ' and 'belonging to the owner of a mine ' is obvious.\\nIn New Satgram Engineering Works ' case, this 214 Court observed that it was therefore possible to contend that lands A and buildings appurtenant to a coal mine, if not exclusively used for the purposes of the colliery business, would not come within the definition of 'mine ' in s.2(h) i.e. it would depend upon the nature of user, and that the crucial date is the date of vesting.\\nIt then went on to say that the distinction though apparent may not be real in the facts and circumstances of a particular case.\\nThe workshop or a building constructed initially for the purposes of a coal mine cannot by itself being diverted to other purposes cease to belong to a mine.\\nWhat is of essence is whether the workshop or building originally formed a part and parcel of a coal mine.\\nThe Court laid down that the subsequent user may not be very material.\\nThe High Court was clearly in error in directing the parties to have the matter settled by a civil suit.\\nParliament by an enlarged definition of 'mine ' in s.2(h) of the Act has indicated the nature of the properties that vest and the question whether a particular asset is taken within the sweep of s.2(h) depends on whether it answer the description given therein.\\nThe staff car in question was undoubtedly a fixed asset of the North Chirimiri Collieries and it, belonging to respondent No. 1 the United Collieries Ltd., the owners in relation to the said mine, being the staff car of the Technical Advisor, was 'fixed asset ' belonging to the mine.\\nlt is righly not suggested that the staff car was not a fixed asset. 'Fixed assets ' in general comprise those asset which are held for the purpose of conducting a business, in contradistinction to those assets which the proprietor holds for the purpose of converting into cash, and they include real estate, building, machinery etc.\\n; Words & Phrases, Permanent Edition, Vol. 17, p. 161; Blacks Law Dictionary, 5th edn., p.573; Stroud 's Judicial Dictionary, 4th edn., Vol.1, p.201.\\nThe staff car therefore fell within the definition of 'mine ' as contained in s.2(h)(xii) and vested in the Central Government under sub section\\n(1) of s.3 Coal Mines (Nationalization) Act, 1973.\\nMerely because the Technical Advisor was putting the staff car to his personal use or for multifarious activities of the Thapar Group of industries would not alter the true legal position since the subsequent user for a different purpose was not really germane.\\nFor these reasons, the appeal must therefore succeed and is allowed, with costs.\\nThe judgment and order passed by the High Court dated October 27, 1980 relegating the parties to a civil suit is set aside and the writ petition filed by the respondents is dismissed.\\nS.R.

Patanjali Sastri and Das JJ.\\ndelivered separate judgments.\\nKANIA C.J. This is an appeal from a judgment of the High Court at Bombay, ordering the release of the respondent who was detained in custody under a detention order made under the (IV of 1950).\\nThe re spondent was first arrested on the 18th of December, 1948, under the Bombay 171 Public Security Measures Act, 1948 (Bombay Act IV of 1947), but was released on the 11th of November, 1949.\\nHe was arrested again on the 21st of April, 1950, under the Preven tive Detention Act, 1950, and on the 29th of April, 1950`, grounds for his detention 'were supplied to him.\\nThey were in the following terms: \\\"That you are engaged and are likely to be engaged in promoting acts of sabotage on railway and railway property in Greater Bombay.\\n\\\" The respondent filed a habeas corpus petition on the 31st of July, 1950, in which, after reciting his previous arrest and release, in para graphs 6 and 7 he mentioned as follows : \\\"(6) On his release the applicant left Bombay and stayed out of Bombay, that is, in Ratlam and in Delhi.\\n(7) On 20th April, 1950, he returned to Bombay and was immediately arrested as stated above.\\\" He contended that the sole aim of the Government in ordering his detention was not the preservation of public order or the security of the State, but the locking up of active trade unionists who belonged to the All India Trade Union Congress.\\nHe contended that the ground is \\\"delight fully vague and does not mention when, where or what kind of sabotage or how the applicant promoted it.\\\" He further urged that the ground gave no particulars and therefore was not a ground as required to be furnished under the .\\nHe stated that the present appellant acted mala fide, for a collateral purpose, outside the scope of the Act, and that the applicant 's detention in any event was illegal and mala fide.\\nWhen this petition was presented to the Court on the 9th of August, 1950, it directed the issue of a notice to the Commissioner of Police.\\nPending the disposal of the Rule, on the 26th August, 1950, the Commissioner of Police sent a communication to the respond ent as follows: \\\"In pursuance of section 7 of the (Act IV of 1950), and in continuation of my commu nication No. 227 dated the 29th April, 172 1950, the following further particulars are hereby communi cated to you in connection with the grounds on which a detention order has been made against you under sub section (1) of section 3 of the said Act : That the activities mentioned in the grounds furnished to you were being carried on by you in Greater Bombay be tween January 1950 and the date of your detention; and In all probability you will continue to do so.\\nIf, in view Of the particulars now supplied, you wish to make a further representation against the order under which you are detained, you should address it to the Government of Bombay and forward it through the Superintend ent of Arthur Road Prison, Bombay.\\n\\\" On the 30th of August, 1950, the Commissioner of Police filed an affidavit against the petition of the respondent in which it was stated that the objectionable activities were carried on by the applicant between the months of January, 1950, and the date of detention.\\nIt further stated that in or about the month of January, 1950, there was a move for a total strike on the railways in India in the month of March, 1950, and the applicant was taking prominent part to see that the strike was brought ' about and was successful.\\nAs a means to make the strike successful and bring about total cessation of work on all railways, the applicant and his associates were advocating sabotage on railways and railway property in Greater Bombay.\\nHe further stated that reliable materials were put before him of the respondent being en gaged in such activities by experienced police officers.\\nHe added that although the railways strike in the month of March did not materialise, the idea of bringing about such strike as soon as convenient continued to be entertained and the present respondent was actively engaged in bringing about such a strike in the near future.\\nHe then stated that the disclosure of further facts relating to the activities of the detenue was against public interest.\\nIn para.\\n6 there was a specific denial that 173 the respondent, after his release in November, 1949, and till 20th April, 1950, was out of Bombay.\\nIt was stated that he used to go out of Bombay at times but during the major part of the period he was in the city of Bombay.\\nWhen the matter came up before a Bench of the High Court the respondent 's petition was granted.\\nIn the judgment of the Court, Chagla C.J. observed: \\\"It is clear by reason of the view we have taken in several cases under section 491 of the Criminal Procedure Code, that this is not a ground which would enable the detenue to make a representation to which he is entitled both under the Act and under the Constitu tion.\\\" After noticing the affidavit of the Commisioner of Police, it was further observed: \\\"We appreciate the fact that, after our decision was given, Government decided to place all the materials before us so that we should be satisfied that what influenced the detaining authority in making the order was not any ulterior motive but that ample materials were at the disposal of the detaining authority which would justify the applicant 's detention.\\nWe have looked at this affidavit and we have also looked at the particulars furnished to us by Mr. Chudasama.\\nIf these particulars had been furnished at the time when the grounds were furnished on the 29th of April, 1950, very likely we would have come to the conclusion that the grounds were such as would have led the detenue to; know exactly what he was charged with and to make a proper representation.\\n\\\" The judgment is however based on the following observation of the Chief Justice: \\\"Anew and important question arises for our consideration; and that is whether it is permissible to the detaining authority to justify the detention by amplify ing and improving the grounds originally furnished . .\\nThe only grounds which we have to consider and which were furnished in the purported compli ance of article 22(5) were the grounds furnished to the detenue on the 29th of April, 1950; and if these grounds were not such as to enable the detenue to make a proper representation, then there was a 174 violation of the fundamental right and a contravention of the statutory provisions.\\nThat violation and that contra vention cannot be set right by the detaining authority by amplifying or improving the grounds already given.\\nAs we said before, the point of time at which we have to decide whether there was a compliance or not with the provisions of article 22 (5) is the 29th of April, 1950, when the grounds were furnished, and not when further and better particulars were given on the 26th of August 1950.\\n\\\" The learned Attor ney General, appearing for the appellant, has strenuously objected to this line of approach.\\nAs the question of vagueness of grounds for the order of detention and the question whether supplementary grounds could be furnished after the grounds were first given to the detenue have arisen in various High Courts, we think it right that the general principles should be properly appreciated.\\nThe Constitution of India has given legisla tive powers to the States and the Central Government to pass laws permitting preventive detention.\\nIn order that a legis lation permitting preventive detention may not be contended to be an infringement of the Fundamental Rights provided in Part III of the Constitution, article 22 lays down the permissible limits of legislation empowering preventive detention.\\nArticle 22 prescribes the minimum procedure that must be included in any law permitting preventive detention and as and when such requirements are not observed the detention, even if valid an initio, ceases to be \\\"in accord ance with procedure established by law\\\" and infringes the fundamental right of the detenue guaranteed under articles 21 and 22 (s) of the Constitution.\\nIn that way the subject of preventive detention has been brought into the chapter on Fundamental Rights.\\nIn the 3resent case we are concerned only with clauses (5) and (6) of article 22 which run as follows: 22. \\\"(5) When any person is detained in pursuance of an order made under any law providing for preventive detention, the authority making the order shall, 175 as soon as may be, communicate to such person the ground on which the order has been made and shall afford him the earliest opportunity of making a representation against the order.\\n(6) Nothing in clause (5) shall require the authority making any such order as is referred to in that clause to disclose facts which such authority considers to be against the public interest to disclose.\\n\\\" It has to be borne in mind that the legislation in question is not an emergency legislation.\\nThe powers of preventive detention under this Act of 1950 are in addition to those contained in the Criminal Procedure Code, where preventive detention is followed by an inquiry or trial.\\nBy its very nature, preventive detention is aimed at preventing the commission of an offence or preventing the detained person from achieving a certain end.\\nThe authority making the order therefore cannot always be in possession of full detailed information when it passes the order and the infor mation in its possession may fall far short of legal proof of any specific offence, although it may be indicative of a strong probability of the impending commission of a prejudi cial act.\\nSection a of the there fore requires that the Central Government or the State Government must be satisfied with respect to any person that with a view to preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to (1) the defence of India, the relations of India with foreign powers, or the security of India, or (2) the security of the State or the maintenance of public order, or (8) the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community . . it is necessary So to do, make an order directing that such person be detained.\\nAccording to the wording of section 3 therefore before the Government can pass an order of preventive detention it must be satisfied with respect to the individual person that his activities are directed against one or other of the three objects mentioned in the section, and that the detaining authority was satisfied that it was necessary to prevent him from 23 176 acting in such a manner.\\nThe wording of the section thus clearly shows that it is the satisfaction of the Central Government or the State Government on the point which alone is necessary to be established.\\nIt is significant that while the objects intended to be defeated are mentioned, the different methods, acts or omissions by which that can be done are not mentioned, as it is not humanly possible to give such an exhaustive list.\\nThe satisfaction of the Government however must be based on some grounds.\\nThere can be no satisfaction if there are no grounds for the same.\\nThere may be a divergence of opinion as to whether certain grounds are sufficient to bring about the satisfaction required by the section.\\nOne person may think one way, another the other way.\\nIf, therefore, the grounds on which it is stated that the Central Government or the State Gov ernment was satisfied are such as a rational human being can consider connected in some manner with the objects which were to be prevented from being attained, the question of satisfaction except on the ground of mala fides cannot be challenged in a court.\\nWhether in a particular case the grounds are sufficient or not, according to the opinion of any person or body other than the Central Government or the State Government, is ruled out by the wording of the sec tion.\\nIt is not for the court to sit in the place of the Central Government or the State Government and try to deter mine if it would have came to the same conclusion as the Central or the State Government.\\nAs has been generally observed, this is a matter for the subjective decision of the Government and that cannot be substituted by an objec tive test in a court of law.\\nSuch detention orders are passed on information and materials which may not be strict ly admissible as evidence under the Evidence Act in a court, but which the law, taking into consideration the needs and exigencies of administration, has allowed to be considered sufficient for the subjective decision of the Government.\\nAn order having been so permitted to be made, the next step to be considered is, has the detained person 177 any say in the matter? In the chapter on Fundamental Rights, the Constitution of India, having given every citizen a right of freedom of movement, speech, etc. with their relative limitations prescribed in the different articles in Part III, has considered the position of a person detained under an order made under a .\\nThree things are expressly considered.\\nin article 22 (5) it is first considered that the man so detained has a right to be given as soon as may be the grounds on which the order has been made.\\nHe may otherwise remain in custody without having the least idea as to why his liberty has been taken away.\\nThis is considered an elementary right in a free democratic State.\\nHaving received the grounds for the order of deten tion, the next point which is considered is, \\\"but that is not enough; what is the good of the man merely knowing grounds for his detention if he cannot take steps to redress a wrong which he thinks has been committed either in belief in the grounds or in making the order.\\\" The clause therefore further provides that the detained person should have the earliest opportunity making a representation against the order.\\nThe representation has to be against the order of detention because the grounds are only steps for the satis faction of the Government on which satisfaction the order of detention has been made.\\nThe third thing provided is in clause (6).\\nIt appears to have been thought that in convey ing the information to the detained person there may be facts which cannot be disclosed in the public interest.\\nThe authorities are therefore left with a discretion in that connection under clause (6).\\nThe grounds which form the basis of satisfaction when formulated are bound to contain certain facts, but mostly they are themselves deductions of facts from facts.\\nThat is the general structure of article 22, clauses (5) and (6), of the Constitution.\\nThe question arising for discussion is what should be stated in the grounds.\\nIt is argued that whatever may be stated or omitted to be stated, the ground cannot be vague;that the Constitution envisages the 178 furnishing of the grounds once and therefore there is no occasion for furnishing particulars or supplemental grounds at a later stage; and that article 22 (5) does not give the detained person a right to ask for particulars, nor does it give the authorities any right to supplement the grounds, once they have furnished the same.\\nIn our opinion much of the controversy is based on a somewhat loose appreciation of the meaning of the words used in the discussion.\\nWe think that the position will be clarified if it is appreciated in the first instance what are the rights given by article 22 (5). 'The first part of article 22, clause (5), gives a right to the detained person to be furnished with \\\"the grounds on which the order has been made\\\" and that has to be done \\\"as soon as may be.\\\" The second right given to such persons is of being afforded \\\"the earliest opportunity of making a representation against the order.\\n\\\" It is obvious that the grounds for making the order as mentioned above, are the grounds on which the detaining authority was satis fied that it was necessary to make the order.\\nThese grounds therefore must be in existence when the order is made.\\nBy their very nature the grounds are conclusions of facts and not a complete detailed recital of all the facts.\\nThe con clusions drawn from the available facts will show in which of the three categories of prejudicial acts the suspected activity of the particular person is considered to fall, These conclusions are the \\\"grounds\\\" and they must be sup plied.\\nNo part of such \\\"grounds\\\" can be held back nor can any more \\\"grounds\\\" be added thereto.\\nWhat must be supplied are the \\\"grounds on which the order has been made\\\" and nothing less.\\nThe second right of being afforded the \\\"earliest opportunity of making a representation against the order\\\" is not confined to only a physical opportunity by supplying paper and pen only.\\nIn order that a representa tion can be made the person detained must first have knowl edge of the grounds on which the authorities conveyed that they were satisfied about the necessity of making the detention order.\\nIt is therefore clear that if the repre sentation has to be intelligible to meet the charges 179 contained in the grounds, the information conveyed to the detained person must be sufficient to attain that object.\\nOrdinarily, the \\\"grounds\\\" in the sense of conclusions drawn by the authorities will indicate the kind of prejudicial act the detenue is suspected of being engaged in and that will be sufficient to enable him to make a representation setting out his innocent activities to dispel the suspicion against him.\\nOf course if the detenue is told about the details of facts besides the grounds he will certainly be in a better position to deal with the same.\\nIt is significant that the clause does not say that the \\\"grounds\\\" as well as details of facts on which ' they are based must be furnished or fur nished at one time.\\nThe law does not prescribe within what time after the grounds are furnished the representation could be made.\\nThe time in each case appears deliberately unprovided for expressly, because 'circumstances vary in each case and make it impossible to fix a particular time for the exercise of each of these two rights.\\nIt thus appears clear that although both these rights are separate and are to be exercised at different times, they are still connected with each other.\\nWithout getting information sufficient to make a representation against the order of detention it is not possible for the man to make the representation.\\nIndeed the right will be only illusory but not a real right at all.\\nThe right to receive the grounds is independent but it is thus intentionally bound up and connected with the right to make the representation.\\nAlthough these two rights are thus linked up, the contingen cy of further communication between the furnishing of the grounds on which the order is made and the exercise of the right of representation granted by the second part of that clause is not altogether excluded.\\n, One thing is clear from the wording of this clause and that is that after the grounds are once conveyed to the detenue there can be no addition to the grounds.\\nThe grounds being the heads, from which the Government was satisfied that it was necessary to pass the order of detention, there can be no addition to those 180 grounds because such additional grounds will be either the grounds which were not elements to bring about the satisfac tion of the Government or if they were such grounds there has been a breach of the provision of the first part of article 22 (5), as those grounds for the order of detention were not conveyed to the detained person \\\"as soon as may be.\\n\\\" This however does not mean that all facts leading to the conclusion mentioned in the grounds must be conveyed to the detained person at the same time the grounds are conveyed to him.\\nThe facts on which the conclusion mentioned in the grounds are based must be available to the Government, but there may be cases where there is delay or difficulty in collecting the exact data or it may not be convenient to set out all the facts in the first communication.\\nIf the sec ond ' communication contains no further conclusion of fact from facts, but only furnishes all or some of the facts on which the first mentioned conclusion was rounded it is obvious that no fresh ground for which the order of detention was made is being furnished to the detained person by the second communication which follows some time after the first communication.\\nAs regards the contents of that communication therefore he test appears to be whether what is conveyed in the second communication is a statement of facts or vents, which facts or events were already taken into consideration in arriving at the conclusion included in the ground already supplied.\\nIf the later communication contains facts leading to a conclusion which is outside the ground first supplied, the same cannot be looked into as supporting the order of detention and therefore those grounds are \\\"new\\\" grounds.\\nIn our opinion that is the more appropriate expression to be used.\\nThe expression \\\"addi tional grounds\\\" seems likely to lead to confusion of thought.\\nThe next point to be considered is the time factor.\\nif a second communication becomes necessary, when should it be made ? Clause 22 (5) lays down two time factors.\\nThe first is that the grounds should be supplied \\\"as soon as may be \\\" This allows the 181 authorities reasonable time to formulate the grounds on the materials in their possession.\\nThe time element is neces sarily left indeterminate because activities of individuals tending to bring about a certain result may be spread over a long or a short period, or a larger or a smaller area, or may be in connection with a few or numerous individuals.\\nThe time required to formulate the proper grounds of deten tion, on information received, is bound to vary in individu al cases.\\nThere is no doubt that no express words are used to suggest a second communication from the authority to the detained person.\\nBut having regard to the structure of the clause dealing with the two rights connected by the word \\\"and \\\", and the use of the words \\\"as soon as may be\\\" and \\\"earliest opportunity\\\" separately, indicating two distinct time factors, one in respect of the furnishing of grounds and the other in respect of the making of the representa tion, the contingency of a second communication after the grounds are furnished, is not excluded.\\nHowever, the second communication should not be liable to be charged as not being within the measure \\\"as soon as may be \\\".\\nSecondly, it must not create a new ground on which satisfaction of the Government could be suggested to have been arrived at.\\nIn our opinion, if these two conditions are fulfilled, the objection against a later communication of details or facts is not sufficient to cause an infringement of the provision made in article 22(5).\\nThe question has to be approached from another point of view also.\\nAs mentioned above, the object of furnishing grounds for the order of detention is to enable the detenue to make a representation, i.e., to give him an opportunity to put forth his objections against the order of detention.\\nMoreover, \\\"the earliest opportuni ty\\\" has to be given to him to do that.\\nWhile the grounds of detention are thus the main factors on which the subjective decision of the Government is based, other materials on which the conclusions in the grounds are rounded could and should equally be conveyed to the detained person to enable him to make out his objections against the 182 order.\\nTo put ,it in other words, the detaining authority has made its decision and passed its order.\\nThe detained person is then given an opportunity to urge his objections which in cases of preventive detention comes always at a later stage.\\nThe grounds may have been considered suffi cient by the Government to pass its judgment.\\nBut to enable the detained person to make his representation against the order, further details may be furnished to him.\\nIn our opinion, this appears to be the true measure of the proce dural rights of the detained person under article 22 (5).\\nIt was argued that under article 22 (6) the authorities are permitted to withhold facts which they consider not desirable to be disclosed in the public interest.\\nIt was argued that therefore all other facts must be disclosed.\\nIn our opinion that is not the necessary conclusion from the wording of article 22 (6).\\nIt gives a right to the detaining authority not to disclose such facts, but from that it does not follow that what is not stated or considered to be withheld on that ground must be disclosed and if not dis closed, there is a breach of a fundamental right.\\nA wide latitude is left to the authorities in the matter of disclo sure.\\nThey are given a special privilege in respect of facts which are considered not desirable to be disclosed in public interest.\\nAs regards the rest, their duty is to disclose facts so as to give the detained person the earliest oppor tunity to make a representation against the order of deten tion.\\nOn behalf of the respondent, it was argued that if the grounds of detention are vague or insufficiently clear there will result a failure to give him the earliest opportunity to make a representation against the order of detention and that defect in its turn must affect the satisfaction on which the order of detention was made.\\nIt was argued that just as a ground which is completely irrelevant, and there fore, in law is no ground at all, could not satisfy any rational person about the necessity for the order, a vague ground 183 which is insufficient to enable the detenue to make a repre sentation would similarly make the order of detention based on it, void.\\nIn our opinion, this argument is un sound.\\nAlthough the ground may be good there may be a certain indefiniteness in its statement.\\nProceeding on the footing that there is some connection, i.e., the ground by itself is not so convincingly irrelevant and incapable of bringing about satisfaction in any rational person, the question whether such ground can give rise to the satisfac tion required for making the order is outside the scope of the inquiry of the court.\\nOn the other hand, the question whether the vagueness or indefinite nature of the statements furnished to the detained person is such as to give him the earliest opportunity to make a representation to the author ity is a matter within the jurisdiction of the court 's inquiry and subject to the court 's decision.\\nThe analogy sought to be drawn between a ground which can have no connection whatsoever with the order and a ground which on its face has connection with the order but is not definite in its statement, is clearly faulty.\\nThe extreme position, on the other hand, that there is no connection between the ground to be furnished and the representation to be made by the detained person under article 22 (5) is equally unsound, when the object in furnishing the ground is kept in mind.\\nThe conferment of the right to make a representation necessarily carries with it the obligation on the part of the detaining authority to furnish the grounds, i.e., materials on which the detention order was made.\\nIn our opinion, it is therefore clear that while there is a connec tion between the obligation on the part of the detaining authority to furnish grounds and the right given to the detained person to have an earliest opportunity to make the representation, the test to be applied in respect of the contents of the grounds for the two purposes is quite dif ferent.\\nAs already pointed out, for the first, the test is whether it is sufficient to satisfy the authority.\\nFor the second, the test is, 24 184 whether it is sufficient to enable the detained person to make the representation at the earliest opportunity.\\nThe argument advanced on behalf of the respondent mixes up the two rights given under article 22 (5) and converts it into one indivisible right.\\nWe are unable to read article 22 (5) in that way.\\nAs pointed out above, the two rights are connected by the word \\\"and\\\".\\nFurthermore, the use of the words \\\"as soon as may be\\\" with the obligation to furnish the grounds of the order of detention, and the fixing of another time limit, viz. the earliest opportunity, for making the representation, makes the two rights distinct.\\nThe second right, as it is a right of objection, has to depend first on the service of the grounds on which the conclusion, i.e., satisfaction of the Government about the necessity of making the order, is based.\\nTo that extent, and that extent alone, the two are connected.\\nBut when grounds which have a ration al connection with the ends mentioned in section a of the Act are supplied, the first condition is satisfied.\\nIf the grounds are not sufficient to enable the detenue to make a representation, the detenue can rely on his second right and if he likes may ask for particulars which will enable him to make the representation.\\nOn an infringement of either of these two rights the detained person has a right to approach the court and complain that there has been an infringement of his fundamental right and even if the infringement of the second part of the right under article 22 (5) is established he is bound to be released by the court.\\nTo treat the two rights mentioned in article 22 (s) as one is neither proper according to the language used, nor according to the purpose for which the rights are given.\\nThe contention that the grounds are vague requires some clarification.\\nWhat is meant by vague ? Vague can be considered as the antonym of 'definite '.\\nIf the ground which is supplied is incapable of being understood or de fined with sufficient certainty it can be called vague.\\nIt is not possible to state affirmatively more on the question of what is vague.\\nIt must vary according to the circum stances of each case.\\nIt is 185 however improper to contend that a ground is necessarily vague if the only answer of the detained person can be to deny it.\\nThat is a matter of detail which has to be examined in the light of the circumstances of each case.\\nIf on reading the ground furnished it is capable of being intel ligently understood and is sufficiently definite to furnish materials to enable the detained person to make a represen tation against the order of detention it cannot be called vague.\\nThe only argument which could be urged is that the language used in specifying the ground is so general that it does not permit the detained person to legitimately meet the charge against him because the only answer which he can make is to say that he did not act as generally suggested.\\nIn certain cases that argument may support the contention that having regard to the general language used in the ground he has not been given the earliest opportunity to make a repre sentation against the order of detention.\\nIt cannot be disputed that the representation mentioned in the second part of article 22 (5) must be one which on being considered may give relief to the detained person.\\nThe argument that supplementary grounds cannot be given after the grounds are first given to the detenue, similarly requires a closer examination.\\nThe adjective \\\"supplemen tary\\\" is capable of covering cases of adding new grounds to the original grounds, as also giving particulars of the facts which are already mentioned, or of giving facts in addition to the facts mentioned in the ground to lead to the conclusion of fact contained in the ground originally fur nished.\\nIt is clear that if by \\\"supplementary grounds\\\" is meant additional grounds, i.e., conclusions of fact required to bring about the satisfaction of the Government, the furnishing of any such additional grounds at a later stage will amount to an infringement of the first mentioned right in article 22 (5) as the grounds for the order of detention must be before the Government before it is satisfied about the necessity for making the order and all such grounds have to be furnished 186 as soon as may be.\\nThe other aspects, viz., the second communication (described as supplemental grounds) being only particulars of the facts mentioned or indicated in the grounds first supplied, or being additional incidents which taken along with the facts mentioned or indicated in the ground already conveyed lead to the same conclusion of fact, (which is the ground furnished in the first instance) stand on a different footing.\\nThese are not new grounds within the meaning of the first part of article 22 (5).\\nThus, while the first mentioned type of \\\"additional\\\" grounds cannot be given after the grounds are furnished in the first instance, the other types even if furnished after the grounds are furnished as soon as may be, but provided they are furnished so as not to come in conflict with giving the earliest opportunity to the detained person to make a repre sentation, will not be considered an infringement of either of the rights mentioned in article 22 (5) of the Constitu tion.\\nThis detailed examination shows that preventive deten tion is not by itself considered an infringement of any of the fundamental rights mentioned in Part III of the Consti tution.\\nThis is, of course, subject to the limitations prescribed in clause (5) of article 22.\\nThat clause, as noticed above, requires two things to be done for the person against whom the order is made.\\nBy reason of the fact that clause (5)forms part of Part III of the Constitution, its provisions have the same force and sanctity as any other provision relating to fundamental rights.\\nAs the clause prescribes two requirements, the time factor in each case is necessarily left fluid.\\nWhile there is the duty on the part of the detaining authority to furnish grounds and the duty to give the detained person the earliest opportunity to make a representation, which obligations, as shown above, are correlated, there exists no express provision contemplating a second communication from the detaining authority to the person detained.\\nThis is because in several cases a second communication may not be necessary at all.\\nThe only thing which emerges from the discussion is that while the authori ties must 187 discharge the duty in furnishing grounds for the order detention \\\"as soon as may be\\\" and also provide \\\"the earliest opportunity to the detained person to ' make the representa tion\\\", the number of communications from the detaining authority to the detenue may be one or more and they may be made at intervals, provided the two parts of the aforesaid duty are discharged in accordance with the wording of clause (5).\\nSo long as the later communications do not make out a new ground, their contents are no infringement of the two procedural rights of the detenue mentioned in the clause.\\nThey may consist of a narration of facts or particulars relating to the grounds already supplied.\\nBut in doing so the time factor in respect of the second duty, viz. to give the detained person the earliest opportunity to make a representation, cannot be overlooked.\\nThat appears to us to be the result of clause (5) of article 22.\\nIn numerous cases that have been brought to our notice, we have found that there has been quite an unnecessary obscurity on the part of the detaining authority in stating the grounds for the order.\\nInstead of giving the information with reasonable details, there is a deliberate attempt to use the minimum number of words in the communication convey ing the grounds of detention.\\nIn our opinion, this attitude is quite deplorable.\\nWe agree with the High Court of Bombay in its observation when it says: \\\"In all the matters which have come up before us we have been distressed to find how vague and unsatisfactory the grounds are which the detaining authority furnished to the detenue; and we are compelled to say that in almost every case we have felt that the grounds could have been ampler and fuller without any detriment to public interest.\\n\\\" While the Constitution gives the Govern ment the privilege of not disclosing in public interest facts which it considers undesirable to disclose, by the words used in article 22 (5) there is a clear obligation to convey to the detained person materials (and the disclosure of which is not necessary to be withheld) which will enable him to make a representation.\\nIt may be 188 noticed that the may not even contain machinery to have the representation looked into by an independent authority or an advisory board.\\nUnder these circumstances, it is but right to emphasize that the commu nication made to the detained person to enable him to make the representation should, consistently with the privilege not to disclose facts which are not desirable to be dis closed in public interest, be as full and adequate as the circumstances permit and should be made as soon as it can be done.\\nAny deviation from this rule is a deviation from the intention underlying article 22 (5) of the Constitution.\\nThe result of this attitude of some detaining authorities has been that, applying the tests mentioned ' above, several communications to the detained persons have been found wanting and the orders of detention are pronounced to be invalid.\\nHaving regard to the principles mentioned above, we have to consider whether the judgment of the High Court is cor rect.\\nWe have already pointed out that the summary rejec tion by the High Court of the later communication solely on the ground that all materials in all circumstances must be furnished to the detenue when the grounds are first communi cated, is not sound.\\nWe have indicated the circumstances and conditions under which the later communication may or may not be considered as falling within the purview of article 22 (5) of the Constitution.\\nIn dealing with the position when the grounds were first communicated, the High Court held as follows: \\\"This is not a ground which would enable the detenue to make a representa tion to which he is entitled both under the Act and under the Constitution.\\n\\\" In this case the later communication of the 26th August, 1950, was made after the respondent filed his petition and it appears to have been made to controvert his allegation that he was never in Bombay between January and April, 1950, as alleged in his affidavit.\\nAfter taking into consideration this communication it was observed by Chagla C.J. that if these particulars had been furnished on 29th April, 1950, very likely the 189 court would have rejected the petition.\\nThe court set the respondent free only because of its view that after 29th April no further communication was permissible. ' In our opinion, this view is erroneous.\\nWe think that on the facts of the present case therefore the respondent 's petition should have been dismissed.\\nWe therefore allow the appeal.\\nPATANJALI SASTRI.\\nWhile I concur in the order pro posed by my Lord that this appeal should be allowed, I regret I find myself unable to agree with him on the true meaning and effect of article 22, clause (8), which is reproduced in section 7 of the , (hereinafter referred to as \\\"the Act\\\").\\nPut shortly, the question that falls to be decided is: Is it within the competence of the court to examine the grounds communicated to a person detained under the Act, with a view to see if they are sufficient in its opinion to enable him to make a representation to the detaining authority against the order, and if they are not, to direct his release ? It is now settled by the decision of the majority in Gopalan 's case(1) that article 21 is applicable to preven tive detention except in so far as the provisions of article 22 (4) to (7) either expressly or by necessary implication exclude its application, with the result that a person cannot be deprived of his personal liberty, even for preven tive purposes, \\\"except according to procedure established by law.\\\" Part of such procedure is provided by the Constitution itself in clauses (5) and (6) of article 22 which read as follows: \\\"(5) When any person is detained in pursuance of an order made under any law providing for preventive detention, the authority making the order shall, as soon as may be, communicate to such person the grounds on which the order has been made and shall afford him the earliest opportunity of making a representation against the order.\\n(6) Nothing in clause (5) shall require the authority making any such order as is referred to in that clause (1) ; 190 to disclose facts which such authority considers to be against the public interest to disclose.\\nIf this procedure is not complied with, detention under the Act may well be held to be unlawful, as it would then be deprivation of personal liberty which is not in accordance with the procedure established by law.\\nThe question accord ingly arises as to what are the requirements of article 22 (5) and whether they have been complied with in the present case ? On behalf of the respondent it is urged that the clause provides two safeguards for the person ordered to be de tained, namely, that (1) the grounds of his detention should be communicated to him as soon as may be, and (2) he should be given the earliest opportunity of making a representation against the order.\\nAs there is to be no trial in such cases, the right of making a representation affords, it is said, the only opportunity to the person detained to repell the accusation brought against him and establish his innocence.\\nIt is the communication of the grounds of detention that is expected to give him notice of what he is to meet by making a representation.\\nThe grounds must, therefore, it is sub mitted, give sufficient indication of the nature and extent of the information on which action has been taken against him and must contain sufficient particulars of the time and place of the acts charged, so as to enable him to make his representation effective as far as it is in his power to do so.\\nIf the grounds are vague and do not disclose the sub stance of the information on which the detention has been based, there would be no real compliance with the procedure prescribed by article 22 (s), and the detention must, it is claimed, be unlawful.\\nIn other words, the sufficiency of the grounds for the purpose of enabling the person detained to make an effective representation against the order of deten tion is, in every case, a justiciable issue.\\nIt must now be taken as settled by the decision of this Court in Gopalan 's case(1), which on this point was (1) 191 unanimous, that section 3 of the Act is constitutional and valid notwithstanding that it leaves it to the, \\\"satisfac tion\\\" of the executive government to decide whether action under the Act is to be taken or not against any particular person or persons.\\nThe learned:Chief Justice pointed out (at p. 121) that action by way of preventive detention must be based largely on suspicion, and quoted the remark of Lord Finlay in Rex vs Halliday(1), that a court is the least appropriate tribunal to investigate the question whether circumstances of suspicion exist warranting the re straint on a person.\\nDealing with a similarly worded provision of the Central Provinces and Berar Public Safety Act, 1948, the Federal Court declared in another unanimous judgment, that \\\"The language clearly shows that the respon sibility for making a detention order rests upon the provin cial executive as they alone are entrusted with the duty of maintaining public peace;and it would be a serious deroga tion from that responsibility if the court were to substi tute its judgment for the satisfaction of the executive authority and, to that end, undertake an investigation of the sufficiency of the materials on which such satisfaction was grounded . .\\nThe court can, however, examine the grounds disclosed by the Government to see if they are relevant to the object which the legislation has in view, namely, the prevention of acts prejudicial to public safety and tranquillity, for \\\"satisfaction\\\" in this connection must be grounded on material which is of rationally probative value\\\" Machindar Shivaji Mahar vs The King (2).\\nThese decisions clearly establish, what indeed is plain from the nature of the measure, that preventive detention is a form of precautionary police action, to be employed on the sole responsibility of the executive government whose discretion is final, no recourse being permitted to a court of law by way of review or justification of such action except on allegations of mala fides or irrational conduct.\\n(1) ; , 269.\\n(2) [1949 50] 25 192 When the power to issue a detention order has thus been made to depend upon the existence of a state of mind in the detaining authority, that is, its \\\"satisfaction\\\", which is a purely subjective condition, so as to exclude a judicial enquiry into the sufficiency of the grounds to justify the detention, it seems to me to be wholly inconsistent with that scheme to hold that it is open to the court to examine the sufficiency of the same grounds to enable the person detained to make a representation, for, be it noted, the grounds to be communicated to the person detained are the \\\"grounds on which the order has been made.\\\" Indeed, the logical result of the argument advanced by the respondent 's counsel would be to invalidate section 3 of the Act in so far as it purports to make the satisfaction of the govern ment the sole condition of a lawful detention, for, if clause (5) of article 22 were to be construed as impliedly authorising a judicial review of the grounds of detention to see if they contain sufficient particulars for making a representation, then, the subjective condition prescribed in section 3 would be inconsistent with that clause and there fore void.\\nWhen this was pointed out to counsel he submit ted that the decision in Gopalan 's case (1) as to the con stitutionality of section 3 required reconsideration in the light of his arguments based on article 22, clause (5).\\nAlthough the clause was not then considered from this point of view, it came in for a good deal of discussion in connec tion with section 14 of the Act and the present argument must, in my opinion, be rejected because it runs counter to that decision.\\nApart from this aspect of the matter, I am not much impressed with the merits of the argument.\\nWhile granting, in view of the structure and wording of clause (5), that the grounds communicated to the person detained are to form the basis of his representation against the order, I am unable to agree with what appears to be the major premise of the argument, namely, that clause (5) contemplates an inquiry where the person detained is to be formally charged with (1) [1950] S.C.R.188, 193 specific acts or omissions of a culpable nature and called upon to answer them.\\nAs pointed out by Lord Atkinson in Rex vs Halliday (1), preventive detention ' being a precautionary measure, \\\"it must necessarily proceed in all cases to some extent on suspicion or, anticipation as distinct from proof\\\", and it must be capable of being employed by the executive government in sudden emergencies on unverified information supplied to them by their police or intelligence officers.\\nthe Government, acting honestly and in good faith make an order being \\\"satisfied\\\" on such information, however lacking in particulars, that a person should be detained in the public interest, as they have been empowered by Parliament to do, then all that article 22 (5) requires of them is to communicate as soon as may be the grounds which led to the making of the order, to the person concerned, and to give him the earliest opportunity of making any represen tation which he may wish to make on the basis of what is communicated to him.\\nIf such communication is made and such opportunity is given the detaining authority will have complied with the procedure prescribed by the Constitution, and the person under detention cannot complain that he has been deprived of his personal liberty otherwise than in accordance with the procedure established by law.\\nI can find nothing in article 22, clause (5), to warrant the view that the grounds on which the order of detention has been made must be such that, when communicated to the person detained they are found by a court of law to be sufficient to enable him to make what the court considers to be an adequate representation.\\nThe right to be produced before a Magistrate and to consult and be defended by a legal practi tioner is expressly denied by the Constitution itself to a person under preventive detention [vide article 22 (1), (2) and (3)3 and this.\\nCourt held in Gopalan 's case(2) that there was nothing in the Constitution to entitle him to a hearing even before the detaining authority.\\nAll this underlines the executive character of the function exercised by (1) ; , 275.\\n(2) ; , 194 the authority which does not in any way embark on a judicial or quasi judicial inquiry.\\nIn such circumstances the repre sentation which the person detained is allowed to make to the Government, which is constituted the judge in its own cause, cannot be assumed to be similar in scope or purpose to a defence against a formulated charge in a court of law.\\nThe argument, therefore, that the right of making a repre sentation should be made effective in the sense that such person should be enabled to defend himself successfully if possible, and, for that purpose, the detaining authority should communicate to him the necessary particulars on pain of having the order quashed if such particulars are not furnished, proceeds on a misconception of the true position.\\nPerhaps the most cogent reason for rejecting the argu ment is to be found in the language and provision of clause (6) of article 22.\\n\\\"Nothing in clause (5)\\\", that is to say, neither the right to be informed of the \\\"grounds\\\" of deten tion nor the right to make a \\\"representation\\\" shall \\\"require\\\" the detaining authority to disclose facts which the authority \\\"considers\\\" should not be disclosed in the public interest.\\nIn other words, clause (5) should not be taken to import an obligation to provide particulars which the authority is given an absolute discretion to furnish or withhold.\\nI cannot understand how it can be claimed, in the face of clause (6), that it is incumbent on the executive govern ment to communicate particulars which a court of law consid ers necessary to enable the person detained to make a repre sentation.\\nIt cannot be compulsory to furnish what the authority is given an uncontrolled power to decide to give or to refuse.\\nThe combined effect of clauses (5) and (6) is, to my mind, to require the detaining authority, to communicate to the person affected only such particulars as that authority and not a court of law, considers sufficient to enable the said person to make a representation.\\nIt is worthy of note that in the well known English case of Liversidge vs Anderson C), the existence of a (1) ; 195 similar privilege was regarded as a \\\"very cogent reason\\\" for holding that the words \\\"If the Secretary of State has rea sonable cause to believe\\\" did not raise a justiciable issue as to the existence of such cause as an objective fact.\\nViscount Maugham observed \\\"It is beyond dispute that he can decline to disclose the information on which he has acted on the ground that to do so would be contrary to the public interest, and that this privilege of the Crown cannot be disputed.\\nIt is not ad rem on the question of construction to say in reply to this argument that there are cases in which the Secretary of State could answer the attack on the validity of the order for detention without raising the point of privilege.\\nIt is sufficient to say that there must be a large number of cases in which the information on which the Secretary of State is likely to act will be of a very confidential nature.\\nThat must have been plain to those responsible in advising His Majesty in regard to the Order in Council, and it constitutes, in my opinion, a very cogent reason for thinking that the words under discussion cannot be read as meaning that the existence of 'reasonable cause ' is one which may be discussed in a court which has not the power of eliciting the facts which in the opinion of the Secretary of State amount to 'reasonable cause '.\\n\\\" There was considerable discussion as to the meaning of the words \\\"grounds\\\" and \\\"representation\\\" used in clause (5).\\nThese are words of very wide connotation and, in the view I have expressed, it is unnecessary to define them.\\nIt may, however, be noted that clauses (5) and (6) are not mutually exclusive in the sense that, when clause (6) is invoked, clause (5) ceases to be applicable.\\nWhen, therefore, the detaining authority withholds the material facts under clause (6)and communicates to the person detained the grounds of detention, which in that case must be necessari ly vague, it would still be communicating to him the \\\"grounds\\\" on which the order has been made, and such repre sentation as the person may wish to make on the basis of that communication would 196 still be a \\\"representation \\\", within the meaning of clause (5).\\nThis shows that no precise connotation can be at tributed to the terms \\\"grounds\\\" and\\\" re presentation\\\" as used in clause (5), for in certain cases at least, the one can be vague and the other inade quate from the point of view of the person detained and, on a question of construction they need not be different in other cases.\\nIt was suggested in the course of the argument that clause (5) dealt with two distinct and independent matters, namely, (1) the communication of the grounds of detention, and (2) the affording of an opportunity to make a represen tation against the detention, and that the grounds communi cated need not have any necessary relation to the represen tation provided for.\\nthe right to make a representation, it was said, imported, by implication, an independent obliga tion on the part of the authority to furnish the person detained with sufficient particulars and details of the accusation against him apart from and in addition to the obligation expressly imposed on the authority to communicate the grounds on which the order has been made, for the reason that without such particulars no adequate or effective representation could be made ' against the order, and though the sufficiency of the Grounds on which the order was based had been held not to be open to judicial examination, there was no reason why the sufficiency of the further communica tion implied in the provision for representation should not be justiciable.\\nThe different time limits fixed for he performance of the duties imposed by clause (5) on the detaining authority are said to support this argument.\\nThe construction suggested is, in my opinion, strained and artificial and cannot be accepted.\\nThe collocation in the same clause of the right to be informed of the grounds of detention and the right to make a representation against it indicate, to my mind, that the grounds communicated are to form the basis of the representation and, indeed, are in tended mainly, if not solely, for that purpose.\\nTo suggest that, apart from those grounds, and right of making a repre sentation 197 imports, by necessary implication, a further obligation to give such details and particulars as would render that right effective is, in my opinion, not to ' construe the clause in its natural meaning but to stretch it by the process of implication, so as to square, with one 's preconceived no tions of justice and fairplay.\\nNo support for this construc tion can be derived from the provision of distinct time limits for the communication of the grounds and the afford ing of opportunity for representation.\\nas that can be ex plained by the different degrees of urgency required in the two cases.\\nThe grounds are to be communicated \\\"as soon as may be\\\" which means as soon as possible and imports a much higher degree of urgency than what is implied in affording the \\\"earliest opportunity\\\" which, I take it, means affording writing and communication facilities to the person under detention as soon as he is ready and desires to make the representation.\\nWhile clause (5) does not allow the authority, after making the order of detention and communicating the grounds of such order, to put forward fresh grounds in justification of that order, I can find nothing in that clause to preclude the authority furnishing particulars or details relating to the grounds originally communicated, or the person under detention availing himself of such particulars and making a better or a further representation.\\nNor is there anything to prevent such person from asking for, or the authority from providing, further and better particulars of those grounds where it is in a position to do so.\\nBut the attempt in these and similar proceedings has always been not to secure the necessary particulars but to shift the arena of the contest to the court which, as Lord Finlay remarked in the case already referred to, is the least appropriate tribunal for investigating what must largely be matters of suspicion and not proof and which, for that very reason, might afford the relief hoped for without being in posses sion of all the facts.\\nReference was made to the decisions of several High Courts dealing with the necessity of furnishing particulars of the grounds of detention.\\nBut those decisions 198 turned on the provisions of the various Provincial Public Safety Acts which were passed before the commencement of the Constitution and which, in most cases, specifically provided for the communication of particulars.\\nThose decisions are of no assistance to the respondent as neither in article 22 nor in the Act is there any express provision that particulars of the grounds of detention should be given to the person detained.\\nOur attention was called to the decision of this court in Ishwar Das vs The State(1) as an instance where this court considered the grounds of detention to be vague and directed the release of the petitioner in that case from detention under the Act.\\nAs pointed out in the brief judg ment in that case, no arguments were addressed on the point and the case was disposed of on the view prima.\\nfacie sup ported by the decisions already referred to that, if the grounds were too general and vague to enable the person under detention to make a representation, he was entitled to be released.\\nNo value can therefore be attached to that decision as a precedent.\\nIn the course of the debate it was repeatedly urged that this court should be jealous in upholding the liberty of the subject which the Constitution has guaranteed as a fundamental right and must not adopt a construction of article 22 (5) which would rob the safeguards provided therein of all their efficacy.\\nI am profoundly conscious of the sanctity which the Constitution attaches to personal liberty and other fundamental rights and of the duty of this court to guard against inroads on them by the legislature or the executive.\\nBut when, as has been stated, the Constitu tion itself has authorised preventive detention and denied to the subject the right of trial before a court of law and of consulting or being defended by a legal practitioner of his choice, providing only certain procedural safeguards, the court could do no more than construe the words used in that behalf in their natural sense consistently with the nature, purpose and scheme of the measure thus authorised, to ascertain what (1) Not reported.\\n199 powers are still left to the court in the matter.\\nIt is in this light that I have endeavoured to construe clause (5) and, for the reasons indicated above, I have come to the conclusion that it is not the province of the court to examine the sufficiency of the grounds for the purpose of making a representation, a matter left entirely to the discretion of the executive authority.\\nAn argument in sup port of the liberty of the subject has always a powerful appeal but the court should, in my opinion, resist the temptation of extending its jurisdiction beyond its legiti mate bounds.\\nDAS J.\\nThis appeal from a decision of the Bombay High Court raises a very important question as to the sufficiency of the grounds of an order of detention under the Preven tive Detention Act, 1950.\\nThe question depends, for its answer, on a correct interpretation of clauses (5) and (6) of article 22 of our Constitution which have been reproduced in section 7 of the Act.\\nA similar question has also been raised in another appeal filed in this court by one hundred detenus from the decision of a Bench of the Calcutta High Court, being Case No. 24 of 1950 (Tarapada and Others vs The State of West Bengal)(1).\\nAs the view I. have taken as to the true meaning and effect of the relevant provisions of the Constitution and of the Act has not commended itself to the majority of my colleagues, I express it with a certain amount of diffidence arising out of the high regard I have for their opinions.\\nUnder section 3 (1) (a) of the Act the authority con cerned can make an order of detention only if he is satis fied that, with a view to preventing a person from acting in a manner prejudicial to one or more of the matters referred to in sub clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of clause (a), an order should be made.\\nWhat materials will engender in the mind of the authority the requisite satisfaction under section 3 (1) of the Act will depend on the training and temperament and the habitual mental approach of the person who is the authority to (11) Reported infra at p. 212 (1) Reported infra at p.212.\\n26 200 make the detention order.\\nThe authority concerned may be a person who will not derive the requisite satisfaction except on very precise and full information amounting almost to legal proof or he may be a person equally honest who will be so satisfied on meagre information which may appear to others to be very vague or even nebulous.\\nIf the authority is a person of the first mentioned type, then the \\\"grounds\\\" on which he will make the order will necessarily be more precise and fuller in particulars than the \\\"grounds\\\" on which an order may be made by the authority who is a person of the second mentioned type.\\nThe \\\"grounds\\\" on which the authority who is a person of the first mentioned type makes an order of detention create no difficulty, for such grounds are quite precise and ample, and, when communicated to the detenu, will clearly enable him to appreciate the reasons for his detention and to make his representation.\\nWe are, however, concerned with the \\\"grounds\\\" on which an order of detention may be made by the authority who is a person of the second mentioned type who may derive the requisite satisfaction from the conclusions which he may draw from the available information, which may not be precise or ample but on which, having regard to his source of information, the authority may honestly feel safe to rely and to act.\\nThis last mentioned type of grounds\\\" will, in the following discussion, be referred to as \\\"vague grounds\\\".\\nThe question for our decision is whether an order of detention made in good faith on such \\\"vague grounds\\\" is valid when it is made and whether if valid when made, becomes invalid because these very grounds, when communicated to the detenu, are found to be insufficient to enable him to make a representa tion.\\nThe first question urged by the learned counsel for the detenu is that an order of detention made upon grounds which are too vague to enable the detenu to to make a representa tion against the order is bad ab initio.\\nThe argument is thus formulated.\\nArticle 22 (5) requires two things, name ly, first, that the authority 201 making the order of detention shall, as soon as may be, communicate to the detenu the grounds on which the, order has been made and, secondly, that the authority ' shall afford him the earliest opportunity to make a representation against the order.\\nThe two requirements 'are correlated.\\nThe object of the communication of the grounds, according to the argument, is to enable the detenu to make a representation against the order of detention and the combined effect of the two constitutional requirements is that the grounds on which the order is made must be such as will, when communi cated to the detenu, enable him to make a representation.\\nIf the grounds communicated are too vague being devoid of particulars, then no representation can be made on the basis of them and if no representation can be made on the basis of these grounds, no order of detention could properly have been made on those grounds, for it is the grounds on which the order had been made that have to be communicated to the detenu so as to enable him to make a representation.\\nThe argument, shortly put, is that the implied requirement that the grounds must be such as will enable the detenu to make a representation also indicates the quality or attribute of the grounds on which the order of detention may be made.\\nWhether the grounds satisfy the requirements of article 22 (5) is not left to the subjective opinion of the authority which makes the order of detention but an objective test is indicated, namely, that the grounds must be such as will enable the detenu to make a representation which quite clearly makes the matter justiciable.\\nIf the court finds that no representation may be made on account of the vague ness of the grounds.\\nthe court must also hold that the order made on such vague grounds cannot be sustained.\\nThe next step in the argument is that the provisions of the Preven tive Detention Act, 1950 (Act IV of 1950), which was passed after the Constitution came into effect must be read in the light of article 22 (5) as construed above.\\nSo read, the satisfaction of the authority referred to in section a of the Act cannot be the subjective satisfaction 202 of the authority, for the satisfaction must be founded on grounds which, when communicated later on, will enable the detenu to make a representation which postulates an objective test.\\nThis involves that section 3 (1) (a) of the Act should be read as if the words \\\"on grounds which, when communicated to him, will enable him to make a repre sentation such as is mentioned in section 7 of this Act\\\" occurred after the words \\\"if satisfied with respect to any person\\\" and before the words \\\"that with a view\\\".\\nIf such interpolation of words be not permissible according to accepted canons of construction, then it must be held that in so far as section 3 of the Act makes an order of deten tion dependent on the subjective satisfaction of the author ity, the section is unconstitutional, being repugnant to the provisions of article 22 (5) and the necessary intendment thereof.\\nThe argument so formulated is attractive but on closer scrutiny will be found to be unsound.\\nBefore the Constitution came into force there were laws for the mainte nance of public security in almost all the provinces and in those laws there were provisions similar to the provisions of section 3 of the .\\nIt was held in many cases that in the absence of bad faith, and provided the grounds on which the authority founded its satisfaction had a reasonable relation or relevancy to the object which the legislation in question had in view, the satisfaction of the authority was purely subjective and could not be questioned in any court of law.\\nThe decision of the Federal Court in Machindar Shivaji Mahar vs The King(1) is one of such decisions.\\nVagueness of the grounds on which satisfaction of the authority is founded cannot be treated as on the same footing as the irrelevancy of the grounds, unless the vagueness be such as may, by itself, be cogent evidence in proof of bad faith.\\nIf the grounds are relevant to the objects of the legislation and if there is no proof of bad faith, then mere vagueness of the grounds cannot vitiate the satisfaction founded on them.\\nThe satis faction being subjective, the court (1) at p.831, 203 cannot arrogate to itself the responsibility of judging the sufficiency or otherwise of the grounds.\\nIt is true that at the time those decisions were given the Constitution had not come into force and there were no fundamental rights, but these well established principles were recognised and adopt ed by all members of this court in Gopalan 's case(1) which came up for consideration after the Constitution had come into force.\\nIn that case it was held unanimously that under section 3 of the , the satis faction of the authority was purely subjective and could not, in the absence of proof of bad faith, be questioned at all and that section 3 was not unconstitutional.\\nIt is true that the arguments now advanced were not advanced in exactly the same form on that occasion, but that fact makes no difference, for the arguments have no force as they are founded on the assumption that the grounds on which an order may be made must be such as will, when communicated, be sufficiently full and precise so as to enable the detenu to make a representation.\\nI find no warrant for such an as sumption.\\nIndeed, the fact that this court has held that section 3 of the Act which makes the satisfaction of the authority a purely subjective matter is not unconstitutional clearly destroys the cogency of the argument formulated as hereinbefore stated.\\nThe decision in Gopalan 's case(1) as to the validity of section 3 of the Act makes it impossible to accept this argument.\\nIt is next urged that even if the initial order was not invalid when made because satisfaction was a purely subjec tive matter for the authority alone and the court cannot consider or pronounce upon the sufficiency of the grounds on which the satisfaction was based, nevertheless, the continuance of the detention becomes unlawful if the same grounds when communicated, be found to be vague and devoid of particulars so as to render the making of a representa tion by the detenu somewhat difficult.\\nThe argument is that although the vagueness of the grounds is not (1) ; 204 justiciable at the initial stage when the order is made and so the order cannot be said to be invalid ab initio, the same vagueness of the ground is nevertheless justi ciable at the later stage when they are.\\ncommuni cated, so that if vagueness renders the making of a representation difficult the continuance of the detention at once becomes illegal.\\nUnder article 21 no person can be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law.\\nAs ex plained in Gopalan 's case(1) procedure established by law means procedure enacted by the Legislature, i.e., State made procedural law and not any rule of natural justice.\\nIt was pointed out that the implication of that article was that a person could be deprived of his life or personal liberty provided such deprivation was brought about in accordance with procedure enacted by the appropriate Legislature.\\nHaving so pro vided in article 21, the framers of our Constitution proceeded to lay down certain procedural requirements which, as a matter of constitutional necessity, must be adopted and included in any procedure that may be enacted by the Legislature and in accordance with which a person may be deprived of his life or personal liberty.\\nThose requirements are set forth in article 22 of the Constitution.\\nA perusal of the several clauses of that article will show that the constitutional require ments of procedure which must be incorporated in any law for preventive detention relate to a stage after the order of detention is made under section 3 of the .\\nThe order of detention being thus in accordance with procedure enacted by law which is not inconsistent with, any of the provisions of of the Constitution applica ble to that stage, the order of detention cannot be questioned unless there is proof of bad faith, either direct or indirect.\\nWe have, therefore, to consider whether the detention validly brought about becomes unlawful by reason of subsequent non compliance with the procedural requirements laid down in clause (5) of article 22, for if there is such non compliance, the (1) ; 205 detenu from that moment must be held to be deprived of his liberty otherwise than in accordance with procedure estab lished by law and will, therefore, be entitled to be re leased.\\nI am prepared to concede that there is some correla tion between the two parts of article 22 (5), namely, the communication of the grounds on which the order has been made and the making of the representation by the detained person.\\nThe Constitution insists on the communication of the grounds on which the detention order has been made for some purpose.\\nThat purpose obviously is to apprise the detenu of the reasons for the order of his detention.\\nThe communica tion of the grounds will necessarily enable him, first, to see whether the grounds are at all relevant to the object sought to be secured by the Act.\\nIf they are not, then they were no grounds at all and no satisfaction could be founded on them.\\nThe very irrelevancy of the grounds will be a cogent proof of bad faith on the part of the authority so as to make the order itself invalid.\\nIn the next place, the disclosure of the grounds will tell the detenu in which class his suspected activities have been placed and whether he is entitled to the benefit of having his case scrutinised by the Advisory Board.\\nFinally, the communication of the grounds on which the order has been made will tell him generally the reasons for his detention, and will, there fore, be helpful to the detained person in making his repre sentation which is also provided for in the tatter part of clause (5).\\nThe fact that there is correlation between the two parts of clause (5) does not, however, carry us any further.\\nThere is no warrant for assuming that the grounds to be communicated to the detenu are to be a formal indict ment or a formal pleading setting forth a charge or a case with meticulous particularity nor is there any warrant for the assumption that the representation has to be in the nature of a defence or written statement specifically deal ing with the charge or the case.\\nIndeed, the idea of a trial is foreign to the law of preventive detention.\\nThe very fact that the provisions of clauses (1) and (2) of article 22 206 do not apply to preventive detention clearly excludes the idea of a trial before a tribunal.\\nAs I have said, the grounds will generally indicate the conclusions drawn by the appropriate authority with respect to the suspected activities of any particular person and those grounds, when communicated, will enable the detenu to make a representa tion, for he can easily refer to and set forth his real activities and represent that all his activities are inno cent and cannot possibly give rise to the suspicion indicat ed in the grounds.\\nTo say that clause (5) itself indicates that the grounds must be such as will enable the detenu to make a representation is to read into clause (5) something which is not there.\\nIt is a re statement of the first argu ment in a new form and is fallacious.\\nIn the first place, clause (5) does not in terms say that the authorities shall communicate such grounds as will enable the detenu to make a representation.\\nIn the second place, the decision in Gopa lan 's case(1) militates against this argument, for if the sufficiency of the grounds is not justiciable at the initial stage when the order is made, as held in that case, it is wholly illogical to say that the intention of the Constitu tion is to make the sufficiency of the same grounds justi ciable as soon as they are communicated to the detenu.\\nAs already stated, an order made upon satisfaction founded on vague grounds is quite valid, if the vagueness is not proof of bad faith.\\nUnder clause (5) the authority is to communi cate the grounds on which the order has been made.\\nThis will let the detenu know what operated on the mind of the authority when it made the order.\\nIf the grounds were vague it is the vague grounds that must be communicated, for it was upon those vague grounds that the order had been made.\\nThat is the express provision of the first part of clause (5).\\nThis being the express requirement, the implication that the grounds communicated must be sufficient to enable the detenu to make a representation cannot be read into the clause, for that will militate against the express require ment.\\nIf the order had been made on vague grounds but (1) ; 207 the authority is to communicate precise and well formu lated grounds which will be sufficient for the detenu to make a representation, then the communication will not be of grounds on which the order was made but of something more than what is expressly required.\\nThe express provision must exclude such an inconsistent implied provision.\\nAgain, clause (6)of article 22 gives the authority the right to claim privilege against disclosure of facts in public inter est.\\nNon disclosure of facts will necessarily make the grounds, as communicated, extremely vague and devoid of particulars.\\nIf the construction of clause (5) which is contended for by the detenu 's counsel were correct, then the vagueness of the grounds resulting from the non disclosure of facts under clause will entitle the detenu to be released, for that vagueness also will render the making of a representation impossible or difficult.\\nThat will mean that the claim of privilege given to the authority by clause (6) of article 22 is wholly meaningless and ineffective, and will defeat its very purpose, for the privilege cannot be claimed except at the peril of releasing the detenu.\\nObvi ously that cannot be the intention.\\nIt must, therefore, be held that the vagueness of grounds resulting from non dis closure of facts under clause (6) will not invalidate the order of detention, which was initially valid, on the ground that no representation can be made on the basis of such vague grounds.\\nIn that case by claiming privilege under clause (6) the authority can frustrate the claim of justi ciability of the sufficiency of the grounds.\\nFurther, why should the vagueness of grounds otherwise brought about stand on a different footing ? Clause (5) cannot mean one thing when the privilege is claimed and mean quite the opposite thing when no such privilege is claimed under clause (6).\\nThe initial order is not justiciable.\\nThe claim of privilege is not justiciable.\\nWhy should it be assumed that the sufficiency of grounds for the purpose of making a representation was intended to be justiciable ? I see no logical reason 27 208 for making an assumption which will introduce an objec tive test in a matter which is prima facie intended to be purely subjective.\\nThe argument is then re stated in the following fur ther modified form.\\nClause (5) of article 22 imposes two obligations on the authority making an order of detention, namely, (i) that the authority shall, as soon as may be, communicate the grounds on which the order has been made, and (ii) that the authority shall afford the earliest oppor tunity to the detenu to make a representation against the order.\\nIf the order was made as a result of satisfaction derived in good faith but upon grounds which may be vague, the order will be perfectly good and cannot be challenged in any court.\\nCommunication of such grounds, even if they are vague, will satisfy the first obligation imposed upon the authority.\\nUnder the latter part of clause (5) the authori ty is also under the obligation to afford the earliest opportunity to the detenu to make a representation.\\nIf the grounds on which the order has been made were vague, then the second part of clause (5), independently and without reference to the first part of clause (5), impliedly imposes on the authority an obligation to rectify the defect of vagueness by supplying particulars so as to enable the detenu to make a representation.\\nSupplying of particulars, the argument concludes, is implicit in the second part of clause (5), for without such particulars the detenu is not afforded the opportunity to make a representation.\\nI am unable to accept this line of argument.\\nUnder the first part of clause (5) the grounds on which the order has been made have to be supplied 'as soon as may be. ' The measure of time indicated by the words 'as soon as may be ' must obviously run from the date of detention.\\nLikewise, the latter part of clause (5) requires affording the detenu the earliest opportunity to make a representation.\\nFrom what terminus a quo is the period indicated by the phrase \\\"earli est opportunity \\\"to begin to run ? If that is also to run from the date of the detention, then the two periods under the two parts of clause (5), 209 must necessarily coincide and, therefore, the question of supplying further particulars after the grounds are supplied cannot arise.\\nOn the other hand, the natural meaning of the words of the latter part of clause (5), to my mind, is that the period connoted by the phrase the \\\"earliest opportunity\\\" begins to run from the time the detenu expresses his desire or intention to make a representation.\\nThe making of a representation is the right of the detenu.\\nTo make or not to make a representation is his choice.\\nTherefore, it is only when he decides to make a representation and expresses his desire or intention to make a representation that the earliest opportunity is to be afforded to him to make the desired or intended representation.\\nNow, if the time is to run after the expression of desire or intention on the part of the detenu to make a representation, then the earliest opportunity to be afforded to the detenu can only mean affording him all physical facilities to carry out his desire or intention, for the detenu has decided to make his representation without any further particulars.\\nAccording to the language used in the latter part of clause (5), there is no express provision for supplying particulars.\\nSuppose the grounds on which the order was made and which were communicated to the detenu under the first part were quite precise and sufficient to enable the detenu to make a repre sentation, then affording him the earliest opportunity to make the representation can only mean giving him all physi cal facilities to do so, e.g., by supplying him with paper, pen and ink and when the representation has been drawn up by him, by forwarding the same with due despatch.\\nIn such a case there is no question of supplying further and better particulars.\\nSuppose, again, that the grounds on which the order has been made and which have been communicated to the detenu are regarded by the authority to be quite precise and sufficient for making a representation, is the authority to anticipate that the detenu may find these grounds insuffi cient or that being moved in that behalf the Court may consider them insufficient and 210 then, as soon as the detenu expresses his desire or inten tion to make a representation.\\nis the authority to keep quiet and take the risk of the court releasing the detenu for the vagueness of the grounds or is he to tell the detenu \\\"just wait a little; I think the grounds which I have communicated to you are quite precise and sufficient; lest you or the court find the grounds insufficient for making a representation, I shall supply you with further and better particulars so as to enable you to make the representation ?\\\" The position thus stated is unreal on the face of it.\\nIn my opinion, on a plain reading of clause (5) there is no justification for assuming that a second communication of particulars is contemplated either under the first part or under the second part of clause (5).\\nThis does not, however, mean that the authority may not supply particulars either suo motu or on the application of the detenu.\\nAll that I say is that clause (5) imposes no constitutional obligation on the authority to supply particulars so as to remove the vagueness of the grounds or to enable the detenu to make a representation, and non supply of further particulars does not constitute an infraction of any fundamental right.\\nIt is said that clause (5) of article 22 construed in the way suggested above, would render that clause nugatory for it will then really guarantee no fundamental right at all.\\nI respectfully differ from this view for the criticism does not appear to me to be well founded.\\nCommunication of the grounds, even if vague, will none the less be helpful to the detenu in the several ways I have already mentioned and, therefore, the right to have the grounds on which the order has been made communicated to him is a valuable right which has been recognised as a fundamental right.\\nLikewise, the right to make a representation is a valuable right which is guaranteed by the Constitution.\\nThese rights remain unaffected.\\nIf the the provisions of clause (5) of article 22 of our Constitution on a correct interpretation thereof are found to be inadequate for the protection of the liberty of 211 the detenus it is their misfortune.\\nThe Constitution which the people have given unto themselves is the supreme law and must be upheld and obeyed whether ' or not one likes its provisions, inhibitions and necessary implications.\\nThe court can only draw the, attention of the Parliament to the lacuna or defect, if any, in the Constitution and in the Act so that the lacuna may be supplied or the defect remedied in the constitutional way.\\nOur attention has been drawn to a number of cases where under various provincial laws and before the Constitution the different High Courts have directed the release of the detenu on the basis of the vagueness of the grounds.\\nThose decisions are, however, distinguishable because they were based on legislation which required the communication not only of grounds but also of particulars.\\nThe omission from our Constitution of the provision for communicating the particulars in addition to the grounds which were to be found in those laws is significant, for it may be deliber ate.\\nApart from this, however, those decisions do not appear to me to have any bearing on the correct interpreta tion of our Constitution or of the .\\nIn Iswar Das vs The State(1) the question was not raised or argued as it was made clear in the judgment itself.\\nIn view of what I have stated above, I am of the opinion that as the grounds originally communicated to the detenu were relevant to the objects which the Act had in view and as there is no proof of mala fides the obligations cast upon the authorities under article 22 (5) which have been reproduced in section 7 of the have been fully complied with.\\nEven according to the views expressed by the majority of my colleagues I would be pre pared to hold that the particulars subsequently supplied along with the grounds originally supplied fully enable the detenu to make his representation.\\nIn my opinion there has been no contravention of the fundamental rights of the detenu.\\nI would, therefore, (1) Not reported.\\n212 allow this appeal and reverse the decision of the Bombay High Court.\\nAppeal allowed.\\n\",\n          \"This is another round in a long drawn out saga between HMRC and Marks and Spencer plc (M&S).\\nIt was last before the Supreme Court on 22 May 2013 when Lord Hope gave judgment on the first of five issues.\\nOnly Lord Hope gave a judgment.\\nThe other members of the Court, namely Lord Neuberger, Lord Mance, Lord Reed and Lord Carnwath simply agreed with Lord Hope.\\nI have, as it were, replaced Lord Hope, who has now retired.\\nFor the purposes of corporation tax, M&S claims group relief in respect of losses sustained by two of their subsidiaries, namely Marks & Spencer (Deutschland) GmbH (\\\"MSD\\\"), which was resident in Germany and Marks & Spencer (Belgium) NV (\\\"MSB\\\"), which was resident in Belgium.\\nAs Lord Hope observed at para 1 of his judgment, the claims were originally made and refused by HMRC over ten years ago and raise questions about the availability of cross border group relief and the method of quantifying such relief as is available which, despite having been the subject of nine separate hearings since the case was first considered in December 2002, have still not yet been resolved.\\nThis is thus the tenth such hearing.\\nAs will be seen, one of the striking features of the various hearings is the number of distinguished tax lawyers who have taken part.\\nAs to the losses in respect of which relief is sought, the earliest losses relied upon extend back to 1997 in the case of MSD and back to 1998 in the case of MSB.\\nThe issues\\nThe five issues were summarised by Moses LJ in the Court of Appeal when (as appears below) the dispute came to the Court of Appeal for the second time.\\nHe summarised them thus at [2012] STC 231, para 4: (i) Is the test that the ECJ established to identify those circumstances in which it would be unlawful to preclude cross border relief for losses, the 'no possibilities' test, to be applied (as the Revenue contend) at the end of the accounting period in which the losses crystallised rather than (as M&S contends) the date of claim? This question involves deciding whether the Court of Appeal in the first appeal reached a binding decision on that issue and whether it remains binding on this court in light of subsequent decisions of the ECJ. (ii) Can sequential/cumulative claims be made (as M&S contends) by the same company for the same losses of the same surrendering company in respect of the same accounting period? The Revenue assert that that is not a question decided by the Court of Appeal and is precluded both by UK fiscal rules and by the underlying jurisprudence of the ECJ. (iii) If a surrendering company has some losses which it has or can utilise and others which it cannot, does the no possibilities test (as the Revenue contend) preclude transfer of that proportion of the losses which it has no possibility of using? (iv) Does the principle of effectiveness require M&S to be allowed to make fresh 'pay and file' claims now that the ECJ has identified the circumstances in which losses may be transferred cross border, when at the time M&S made those claims there was no means of foreseeing the test established by the court? (v) What is the correct method of calculating the losses available to be transferred?\\nAs Lord Hope observed in para 10, those issues have been restated in a slightly amended form in the statement of facts and issues prepared for the appeals to this Court.\\nI will return to the facts and issues as so formulated so far as necessary below.\\nThe reference to the no possibilities test established by the ECJ is a reference to the decision of the ECJ in a ruling in a judgment of 13 December 2005 in Case C 446/03, Marks & Spencer plc v Halsey [2006] Ch 184, [2005] ECR I 10837.\\nIn order to be able to follow the thinking of the Court of Appeal and of this Court it is necessary to say something about the history and background which I can take largely from paras 2 to 14 of the judgment of Lord Hope.\\nHistory and background\\nM&S began to expand its business into other countries in 1975.\\nBy the end of the 1990s it had sales outlets in more than 34 countries, with a network of subsidiaries and franchises.\\nBut by that date it had already begun to incur losses, and in March 2001 decided to withdraw from its continental European activity.\\nIt was able to sell its French and Spanish subsidiaries to third parties, but no purchasers could be found for MSD or MSB.\\nMSD ceased trading in August 2001 and was dissolved following liquidation on 14 December 2007.\\nMSB ceased trading on 22 December 2001 and was dissolved following liquidation on 27 December 2007.\\nThe first group relief claims were made between 2000 and 2003 at a time when neither subsidiary was in liquidation.\\nThey concerned MSG's losses for the years 1998 to 2001 and MSB's losses for the years 2001 and 2002.\\nClaims in respect of the same losses by the same companies for the same years were made on three subsequent occasions in response to what (as Lord Hope put it) M&S described as factual and jurisprudential developments: on 20 March 2007, when both companies were in liquidation; on 12 December 2007, just before the companies were dissolved; and on 11 June 2008, in respect of MSB following the dissolution of that company.\\nThe claims for the years from 2000 onwards were governed by the self assessment rules in Schedule 18 to the Finance Act 1998 and (it is now agreed) were within the statutory time limits, to which I will return below.\\nHMRC maintain that the claims for years prior to 2000, which were governed by the corporation tax pay and file rules in Schedule 17A to the Income and Corporation Taxes Act (ICTA) 1988, were out of time when they were included in the claims that were made on the three occasions subsequent to the making of the first claims between 2000 and 2003.\\nAs Lord Hope observed at para 5, M&Ss basic contention underlying all these claims was that the provisions in United Kingdom legislation which restricted group relief claims to losses of UK resident companies and, after the Finance Act 2000, losses of UK branches of non resident companies were contrary to article 43 EC (now article 49 TFEU) on the freedom of establishment, and were thus unlawful.\\nOn I7 December 2002 the special commissioners, who were Dr John Avery Jones and Mr Malcolm Gammie QC, held that there had been no breach of that article: Marks & Spencer plc v Halsey [2003] STC (SCD) 70.\\nOn appeal, Park J decided to refer the matter to the ECJ: [2003] EWHC 1945 (Ch).\\nHe sought a preliminary ruling on two questions, namely (1) the compatibility of the UK provisions with article 43 EC and (2) what difference the facts of M&S's case might make to the answer to the first question.\\nAs stated above, the ECJ gave its ruling in its judgment of 13 December 2005.\\nIt ruled that the answer to the first question was that article 43 EC did not preclude provisions of a member state which prevented a resident parent company from claiming group relief for losses incurred by a subsidiary established in another member state.\\nThe restriction was justified by three grounds when taken together, namely (1) preserving the balanced allocation of the power to impose taxes between member states; (2) preventing losses being taken into account twice in different member states; and (3) preventing the risk of tax avoidance if the taxpayer were to be free to choose the member state in which to claim relief: paras 41 51.\\nIn particular, at para 51 it was said that in principle such restrictive provisions pursue legitimate objectives which are compatible with the Treaty and constitute overriding objectives in the public interest and that they are apt to ensure the attainment of those objectives.\\nHowever the Court noted in effect at para 53 that, in order to be lawful, the measures must not go beyond what is necessary to attain the objectives pursued.\\nIn short the measures must be proportionate.\\nFor present purposes the critical paragraphs are paras 55 and 56: 55.\\nIn that regard, the court considers that the restrictive measure at issue in the main proceedings goes beyond what is necessary to attain the essential part of the objectives pursued where: the non resident subsidiary has exhausted the possibilities (i) available in its state of residence of having the losses taken into account for the accounting period concerned by the claim for relief and also for previous accounting periods, if (ii) necessary by transferring those losses to a third party or by offsetting the losses against the profits made by the subsidiary in previous periods, and there is no possibility for the foreign subsidiarys losses to be taken into account in its State of residence for future periods either by the subsidiary itself or by a third party, in particular where the subsidiary has been sold to that third party. 56.\\nWhere, in one member state, the resident parent company demonstrates to the tax authorities that those conditions are fulfilled, it is contrary to articles 43 EC and 48 EC to preclude the possibility for the parent company to deduct from its taxable profits in that member state the losses incurred by its non resident subsidiary.\\nThe matter then returned before Park J in April 2006.\\nIn Marks & Spencer plc v Halsey (No 2) [2006] STC 1235 he held that the no possibilities test referred to in para 55 required an analysis of the recognised possibilities legally available given the objective facts of the company's situation at the relevant time, and that the test was to be applied at the date when the group relief claim was made.\\nHe remitted the case to the special commissioners, but both parties appealed against his decision.\\nThe Court of Appeal, comprising Chadwick, Tuckey and Jacob LJJ, upheld the judge's findings: [2008] STC 526.\\nThe case then returned to the Tax Chamber of the First tier Tribunal (FTT), which comprised Judge Avery Jones and Judge Gammie (as they had by then become): Marks and Spencer plc v Revenue and Customs Comrs [2009] UKFTT 64 and 231 (TC) and proceeded from there to the Upper Tribunal (UT), which comprised the President, Warren J, and Judge Edward Sadler: [2010] STC 2470 and thence to a second Court of Appeal, comprising Lloyd, Moses and Etherton LJJ [2012] STC 231.\\nIt was in his judgment in that second appeal that Moses LJ, with whom Lloyd and Etherton LJJ agreed, set out the issues as quoted above.\\nThe Court of Appeal dismissed HMRCs appeal on issues one, two and five and dismissed M&Ss appeal on issue four.\\nIt gave both parties permission to appeal to this Court.\\nWhen the matter first came before the Court, as Lord Hope observed at para 2, M&S had intended that issue one would be referred to the ECJ but, in the event, on 21 February 2013, the ECJ gave judgment in the case of A Oy (Case C 123/11).\\nM&S submitted that any doubt that might have existed on the first issue had been dispelled by that ruling, that a reference was no longer necessary and that it could now be answered in their favour.\\nHMRC had objected to M&S's application for a reference on the ground that the answer to the first issue was already clear, although in the event they simply invited the Court to determine this issue in their favour.\\nSo the hearing on M&S's application for a reference became a substantive hearing of the appeal on the first issue.\\nIn retrospect it is perhaps a pity that all five issues were not all considered together on the first occasion because in this appeal, which is concerned with issues two, four and five (issue three having in effect been resolved by the determination of issue one), there has been much debate as to the inferences that can be drawn from the judgment on issue one.\\nIt is of course easy to be wise after the event but the experience of this case shows that, where there are or may be a number of inter related issues of law, it may be better to consider them all together rather than to consider them one by one.\\nIn the event I do not think that this course has affected the result and I recognise that each case must be managed in accordance with its own circumstances but it is something to be borne in mind in the future.\\nIssues one and three\\nIssue one was restated in the statement of facts and issues as follows: In Case C 446/03 Marks & Spencer plc v Halsey, did the ECJ decide that it was contrary to article 43 EC to preclude cross border loss relief in the member state of the claimant company (a) only where the taxpayer can show, on the basis of the circumstances existing at the end of the accounting period in which the losses in question arose, that there was no possibility of the losses in question being utilised in the member state of the surrendering company in that accounting period, in any previous accounting period or in future accounting period (as HMRC contend), or (b) where the taxpayer can show, on the basis of the circumstances existing at the date of the claim, that there has been no possibility of utilising the losses in the member state of the surrendering company in any accounting period prior to the date of the claim and no possibility of such utilisation in the accounting period in which the claim is made or in future accounting periods (as M&S contend)?\\nThe date of the claim was of course the date which both Park J and the first Court of Appeal had held to be the correct date, which was the answer proposed in (b) above: see as to their reasoning paras 11 and 12 of Lord Hopes judgment respectively.\\nAlthough the second Court of Appeal did not agree (see Lord Hope at para 13), it held that it was bound by the decision of the first Court of Appeal (see Lord Hope at para 14).\\nIn para 30 Lord Hope rejected the case for HMRC that the correct answer was that proposed as alternative (a) above, namely that it is contrary to article 43 EC to preclude cross border loss relief in the member state of the company claiming relief only where the taxpayer can show, on the basis of the circumstances existing at the end of the accounting period in which the losses in question arose, that there was no possibility of the losses in question being utilised in the member state of the surrendering company in that accounting period, in any previous accounting period or in future accounting periods.\\nLord Hope rejected Mr Ewart QCs submission on behalf of HMRC that to take a later date than the end of the accounting period would give the taxpayer a choice, which would upset the balanced allocation of the power to impose taxes.\\nMr Milne did not dispute the need to avoid upsetting that balance but submitted that the taxpayer ought to be given an opportunity to deal with it in as realistic a manner as possible.\\nLord Hope accepted that submission.\\nHe said that the approach contended for by HMRC would mean that there would be no realistic chance of satisfying the para 55 conditions at all.\\nIt would hardly ever be possible, if regard were had only to how matters stood at the end of the relevant accounting period, to exclude entirely the possibility that the losses in question might be utilised in the member state of the surrendering company unless, of course, this was prevented by its local law.\\nThe balanced allocation principle did not require to be supported by an approach which restricts the company to that extent.\\nHe said that that was clear from the way the issue was dealt with by the ECJ in A Oy at para 48.\\nIn the course of the oral argument in this Court Mr Milne QC submitted on behalf of M&S that the relevant date was, not the date of the claim, but the later date when the facts were considered, namely the date of the hearing before the FTT.\\nIn para 31 Lord Hope rejected that submission.\\nHowever Mr Milne had not abandoned his original submission, which was now put in the alternative, that the date to be taken was the date of the claim, which was of course the date chosen by Park J and the first Court of Appeal.\\nSuch a date would have the advantage of certainty.\\nLord Hope accordingly opted for option (b).\\nIt is important to note that Lord Hope expressly pointed out at the end of para 31 that the questions whether successive claims could be made and, if so, with what effect, must be left over for consideration under issue two.\\nHe also stressed in para 32 that the national court must be alert to the possibility that the company may simply be choosing in which member state it should be taxed.\\nThe para 55 conditions are designed to exclude that possibility.\\nHe held in para 33 that the question for inquiry is whether the company has been able to show, on the basis of the circumstances known at the date when it makes its claim, that there has been no possibility of the losses in question being utilised in the member state of the surrendering company in any accounting period prior to the date of the claim and no possibility of such utilisation in the accounting period in which the claim is made or in any future accounting periods.\\nFinally, Lord Hope noted that that answer had the consequence that issue three need not be answered.\\nIssue two\\nIssue two is formulated in the statement of facts and issues in this way: If the answer to issue 1 is (b), does the date of claim include the date of sequential/cumulative/alternative claims by the same company for the same losses of the same surrendering company in respect of the same accounting period provided that the statutory time period for claiming loss relief remains open?\\nIn so far as it was suggested on behalf of the HMRC that the conclusions of Lord Hope on issue one are of some assistance in answering this question in favour of the HMRC, I would not accept the submission.\\nAs noted above, Lord Hope made it clear that he was only considering the date as at which the circumstances of a claim were to be determined.\\nHe was not considering the question whether further or alternative claims were permissible and in what circumstances.\\nThat is the question raised by issue two.\\nAlthough cumulative claims are included in issue 2 as formulated, HMRC submitted that the claims are not cumulative because each of the claims is in respect of exactly the same losses.\\nThat is so but does not affect the issue of principle, which is correctly described by HMRC as whether it is open to a claimant company to make a series of sequential claims for cross border loss relief in respect of the same losses of the same surrendering company in respect of the same accounting period.\\nFor the purposes of discussion it is convenient to refer to the later claims as new claims, even though in one sense they may be said to be old claims.\\nHowever described, HMRC submitted that the second, third and fourth group relief claims are not valid claims at all, whether as a matter of domestic law or, more relevantly, for the purpose of the no possibilities test, as a matter of EU law.\\nThe only valid claims are the original claims, in respect of which the FTT determined that the no possibilities test was not satisfied.\\nDomestic law\\nIt is convenient to consider first the position as a matter of domestic law, which was not considered at all for the purposes of the resolution of issue one.\\nThe relevant statutory provisions are set out in Annex A to this judgment, which is taken from the annex to the supplementary case for M&S and is not in dispute.\\nAs noted in para 7 above, M&S made three new claims in respect of the same losses on 20 March 2007, 12 December 2007 and 11 June 2008.\\nHMRC submit that those claims are invalid as a matter of domestic law.\\nThey rely upon para 73(2) of Schedule 18 to the Finance Act (FA) 1998, which provides that a claim for group relief may not be amended, but must be withdrawn and replaced by another claim.\\nThey say that the original claims were not withdrawn and that it follows that the new claims cannot be valid claims.\\nFurther or alternatively, they say that the new claims were not claims at all but merely repetitions of valid claims already made.\\nI would not accept those submissions.\\nThere is in my opinion no support for them in the provisions set out in Annex A below.\\nAs drafted, those provisions do not expressly contemplate cross border relief.\\nOn the contrary, they refer to the surrendering companys tax return in terms that show that the draftsman had in mind the tax return of an English company: paras 69(3), 70(3)(b), 72(1) (3) and 75.\\nMore importantly, there is no support for the conclusion that only one claim can be made.\\nOn the contrary, the provisions contemplate that successive claims can be made.\\nThus para 69(2) provides that a claim is ineffective if the amount exceeds the amount available for surrender at the time the claim is made; para 70(4) provides that a claim is ineffective unless it is accompanied by a copy of the notice of consent to surrender given by the surrendering company; and para 70(3) provides that the claim is ineffective if the necessary consents are not given.\\nImportantly, para 73(2) provides that a claim for group relief may not be amended but must be withdrawn and replaced by another claim.\\nThose provisions are, in my opinion, inconsistent with the proposition that only one claim can be made.\\nSo too are the time limitation provisions in the self assessment rules.\\nIt is common ground that under para 74(1) the time limit for making or withdrawing a claim for group relief does not expire until the latest of the four periods referred to in (a) to (d) (set out in Annex A below), which might take some years where, as is not uncommon, there is an enquiry into the relevant tax return.\\nThose provisions seem to me to be inconsistent with the notion that there can only be one claim.\\nThe UT discussed the structure of the domestic legislation in some detail between paras 67 and 86, in the last of which they expressed their overall conclusion thus: Our overall conclusion with regard to the group relief provisions as they apply in the domestic context under the self assessment regime is that, whilst they are detailed and prescriptive, they are nevertheless both flexible and dynamic: in broad terms, the mechanics of Schedule 18 FA 1998 are directed so as to achieve the result that, in their final form, the tax returns of the claimant and surrendering companies accurately reflect amounts eventually shown to be available for surrender, as supported by corresponding notices of consent.\\nFurther, the processes and adjustments required to reach that final result may continue throughout the period during which it is open for a group company to make a group relief claim (which in practice, under self assessment, is a generous period).\\nThat is all that is required in a self assessment regime, and the flexibility and dynamism are required where, in large groups of companies with complex tax affairs, adjustments and consequential changes are likely to be inevitable and frequent.\\nI agree.\\nIn short, simply as a matter of construction of the relevant provisions, without any manipulation made necessary by the fact that the draftsman did not have cross border relief in mind, there is no support for the conclusion that only one claim can be made.\\nPara 73(2) makes that clear.\\nIt does not provide that successive claims cannot be made.\\nOn the contrary, it expressly provides that a claim for group relief may not be amended but must be withdrawn and replaced by another claim and thus necessarily contemplates that successive claims may be made.\\nThe EU context\\nIt is common ground that, as the UT put it at para 87, in order to give effect to M&Ss Community law rights, some adjustment or remoulding of the domestic legislation was required: Autologic plc v Inland Revenue Comrs [2006] 1 AC 118, per Lord Nicholls at paras 16 17 and 29 30.\\nThe legislation must be construed so as to ensure that those rights are effective in the sense that they are not practically impossible or excessively difficult to exercise and also so as to ensure that the statutory code provides an effective remedy.\\nThe UT identified the problem posed by para 69(2).\\nIt concluded at para 107 that para 69(2) makes no sense if applied literally in the context of a claim for relief in respect of a foreign surrendering company.\\nThe amount available for surrender is not well defined in the context of the no possibilities test by reference to the definition in para 69(3).\\nEven if the reference to the tax return can be read as the equivalent document in a member state to the UK tax return, that document will only provide information relevant to ascertaining the loss according to the law of that state and not UK tax law and will not reveal what, if any, part of the loss satisfies the no possibilities principle.\\nIn these circumstances, at para 108 the UT identified what it described as at least two approaches to the necessary disapplication or moulding of para 69(2) and, for the reasons specified in paras 109 to 111 concluded that the appropriate solution was to disregard para 69(2).\\nThe UT expressed its conclusions thus at para 112: To summarise: in our view, a claimant company seeking group relief in respect of the losses of a foreign group company can make successive claims, provided that all those claims are made within the time limit for claims specified by paragraph 74.\\nIt does not have to withdraw an earlier claim before making another claim.\\nThe validity of the later claim depends on the facts as they are at the time of the later claim.\\nIf the first claim results in no relief being given because at the time that first claim is made the no possibilities test is not fulfilled in respect of any part of the losses in respect of which relief is claimed, a later claim can be made for such amount of those losses as satisfies the no possibilities test as at the time of the later claim.\\nIf an earlier claim is valid in respect of part of the losses (because the no possibilities test is satisfied in respect of part) then a later claim can be made for the balance.\\nThis, in our view puts the company claiming group relief for the losses of a foreign group company in effectively the same position as though it were claiming such relief for domestic losses, after taking account of those factors and difficulties which are not present in the domestic context.\\nIt does not put the claimant company in any better a position (save possibly and if so, legitimately in relation to cash flow) than if it waits until the last possible moment within the time limit period to make its claim, that is, the point at which it is most likely to be able to satisfy the no possibilities test.\\nThat reasoning is not entirely consistent with that of the FTT, which held in its para 36 that the no possibilities test was not satisfied so the claim did not validly claim anything at all.\\nIt added: Accordingly, we find that the first claims were not valid claims at all.\\nIf we are wrong and they had some validity, the Appellant has undertaken to withdraw them and we proceed on that basis.\\nAs I read it, it was not part of the Upper Tribunals reasoning that the first claims were not valid claims at all.\\nHowever, whether they were or not, the taxpayer is entitled to withdraw any unnecessary claims and advance a new claim at any time before such a claim becomes time barred.\\nMoreover, on the facts, I would accept M&Ss submission that it made it clear from the outset that, once the courts had determined which claims were valid, it would withdraw the other claims.\\nThe correspondence amply supports the conclusion that M&S made it clear that their successive claims were made in the alternative to their original claims and that, if the original claims succeeded, they would withdraw their later claims and vice versa.\\nHMRC did not accept that approach but in my view the FTT was entitled to proceed on the basis that, if the first claims failed, M&S had undertaken to withdraw them.\\nSee, to the same effect, the UT at paras 103 and 104.\\nThe second Court of Appeal upheld the decision and reasoning of the Upper Tribunal.\\nMoses LJ summarised their conclusions in paras 57 and 58 in this way: 57.\\nM&S, which made its first claims at a time when the conditions were not satisfied, and when it could not have known whether the conditions could be satisfied since it could not know what those conditions were, can surely not be worse off than if it had made no claim at all.\\nOn the [first] Court of Appeal's understanding of the ECJ's decision, it makes no sense to deprive M&S of the ability to claim cross border losses merely because its claims were premature.\\nIf it should have waited until it could satisfy the paragraph 55 conditions, and it was still in time to make claims to cross border losses, it is difficult to see why it should lose that opportunity because it made its claims too soon.\\nIf the Revenue are correct in their essential argument that the conditions must be applied at the time the losses crystallised then the problem does not arise; no advantage is to be gained by making successive claims.\\nBut once it is accepted, as the [first] Court of Appeal accepted, that a claimant may wait between the end of the accounting period in which the losses crystallised and the expiry of the time for making a claim, there is no reason why a claimant should forfeit the right to make a claim merely because it makes the claim too soon.\\nThe [first] Court of Appeal has recognised a right to claim based on facts which arise after the end of the accounting period, and before the expiry of the time for making a claim.\\nSince there is no restriction against withdrawing a claim and advancing a new claim within that period, there is no good reason to prevent M&S doing so for the purpose of satisfying the paragraph 55 conditions.\\nTo refuse M&S the right to withdraw its earlier claims would put it at an unjustifiable disadvantage as against other potential claimants who have made no claim at all.\\nIf the only inhibition on waiting is the time limit for bringing claims, there can be no reason for refusing to allow M&S to withdraw such claims made at a time when the facts do not satisfy the paragraph 55 conditions, and rely on a claim made at a time when they do.\\nThe only time limit for such withdrawal is that which is consequent on the time limits within paragraph 74. 58.\\nThat result may be achieved, in compliance with paragraph 73, by M&S withdrawing the earlier claims and amending its return to make the claim at a time when the facts do satisfy the conditions in paragraph 55 pursuant to paragraph 75(6) of Schedule 18.\\nI agree.\\nIn addition, at paras 59 to 62 the Court of Appeal expressly approved the mechanics adopted by the UT.\\nSee in particular para 60, where Moses LJ gave his reasons for agreeing that para 69(2) should be ignored as the UT proposed.\\nMoses LJ added at para 61: 61.\\nThe issue, however, is not one of mechanics but of principle.\\nThe Revenue's objection is that a claimant should not be permitted to delay making a claim until it can satisfy the paragraph 55 test and, accordingly should not be permitted to withdraw earlier claims, which do not satisfy that test.\\nBut, like the Upper Tribunal, I see no reason why it should not.\\nEither the Schedule permits such a course or it must be moulded for that purpose.\\nOnce it is acknowledged, as the Court of Appeal decided, that a claim may be delayed from the accounting period in which the losses claimed crystallised to the end of the time for making a claim, there can be no reason not to permit a series of claims being made.\\nIt seems to me that the Revenue's objection can only succeed if they are correct in their essential argument that a claimant cannot rely upon any facts other than those which exist at the time when the losses claimed crystallised.\\nOnce it is accepted that facts which arise subsequently, and up to the expiry of the period for making a claim, are relevant, the objection becomes a mere question of machinery.\\nAgain, I agree.\\nI also agree with Moses LJs conclusion at para 62 that the decision of the first Court of Appeal dictates that the claimant M&S is permitted to make successive claims to the same loss and rely on the claim which satisfies the para 55 criteria, and then withdraw any earlier claims in respect of the same surrendered losses.\\nIn these circumstances I would answer the question posed in issue two in the affirmative, subject to a consideration of a somewhat different point taken by HMRC that this approach offends the principle of legal certainty and jeopardises the preservation of the balanced allocation of taxing rights.\\nHowever, there is nothing in the conclusion which I have reached so far that offends against the principle of legal certainty.\\nThe taxpayer is entitled to advance claims for cross border relief provided that it is in time to do so.\\nI will return to this under issue four below in connection with time bar.\\nAs to the importance of the preservation of the balanced allocation of taxing rights, as indicated above, it was and is correctly accepted on behalf of M&S this is an important principle, as indeed Lord Hope accepted at paras 29 and 30.\\nThe question is essentially a factual question which involves practical considerations.\\nIn reaching these conclusions Lord Hope took account both of Oy AA (Case C 231/05) [2008] STC 991 and of A Oy (Case C 123/11).\\nHe concluded at para 30 that, in carrying out the factual exercise, the taxpayer should be given the opportunity of proceeding in as realistic a manner as possible and that the balanced allocation principle does not require to be supported by an approach as narrow as that proposed by HMRC under issue one.\\nIt was in the light of those considerations that this court held that the facts should be considered as at the date of the claim.\\nFor my part I see no reason why the same approach should not be adopted as at the date of the relevant claim, which for the reasons given above may be made at any time before it becomes time barred.\\nI would accept Mr Milnes submission that there is no inconsistency between that approach and the principle of the balanced allocation of the power to impose taxes.\\nAs stated above, Lord Hope made it clear at para 32 that the taxpayer may simply be choosing in which member state it should be taxed.\\nAgain Mr Milne correctly accepts the validity of that principle but submits that there was no question here of M&S making such a choice and that the FTT resolved this issue in favour of M&S. He also relies upon para 32 more widely: The national court will, of course, be alert to the possibility that the company may simply be choosing in which member state it should be taxed.\\nThe para 55 conditions are designed to exclude that possibility.\\nBut the judgment in A Oy shows that the mere fact that losses can be carried forward at the end of the accounting period in which they arose does not mean that the para 55 conditions cannot be met.\\nMoreover the fact that the merger that was contemplated in that case was not seen as a ground for denying the possibility of taking the losses into account, on the ground that it allowed the parent company to choose freely from one year to the next the tax scheme applicable to its subsidiary's losses, shows that the decisions to wind up MSD and MSB are not open to objection on that ground either.\\nWhat M&S was doing can be attributed to the fact that the companies had ceased trading six years earlier, and not to the exercise of an option to choose where to seek relief for the losses that had been incurred.\\nThere is no reason to think that what it did must be seen as a threat to the balanced allocation of taxing powers.\\nThe principle that lies behind HMRC's approach must, of course, be respected.\\nBut it does not justify the choice of date for which they contend which, as Park J said, is too soon to give the company a reasonable opportunity of showing that the para 55 conditions are satisfied.\\nI appreciate that those views were expressed in the context of issue one but they are to my mind consistent with the findings of fact made by the FTT.\\nThe FTT held at para 29 that at the time of the first group relief claims there was nothing to prevent the losses being used by continuing to trade or starting another trade or business and that it followed that the no possibilities test was not satisfied at the time of any of the first group relief claims.\\nHowever, the FTT reached different conclusions in the case of the second, third and fourth group relief claims.\\nAs to the second relief claims it said this at para 30: The second group relief claims were all made during the liquidation.\\nIn both Germany and Belgium no new activities can be started once the company is in liquidation; the liquidators functions are to pay the liabilities and distribute the assets.\\nIn both countries losses can be carried forward to the liquidation and set against income arising during the liquidation.\\nAs we have concluded in paragraph 25 above, so far as it can be estimated that there will be such income this can be used to offset the losses, but we find that any losses in excess of such estimated income will satisfy the no possibilities test.\\nIn para 31 it notes that the third group relief claims were also made during the liquidation but closer to the end of it, two days before final dissolution for MSG and about two weeks before for MSB.\\nAs to the fourth claim, which related only to MSB, they noted in para 32 that it was made after the dissolution of the company.\\nIn these circumstances the FTT held that the position was the same in the case of each of the second, third and fourth group relief claims because, unlike the first claim, they in principle satisfy the no possibilities test.\\nI can see no realistic basis upon which those conclusions of fact can be challenged.\\nIt follows that, in the light of the answer to the question posed by issue two, the subsequent alternative claims are in principle valid against the event of the prior claims failing under the no possibilities test, subject to the answer to the question posed by issue four.\\nIssue four\\nquestions: As formulated in the statement of facts and issues, issue four asks these Does the principle of effectiveness require M&S in the particular circumstances of the present case to be allowed: (i) to make fresh pay and file or self assessment claims once the ECJ identified the circumstances in which losses had to be permitted to be transferred cross border; and/or (ii) to make sequential/cumulative/alternative self assessment claims while the statutory time period for making claims remained open as the legal position became clearer?\\nAlthough issue four is formulated in that way, the conclusions set out above in connection with issue two to the effect that it is permissible to have sequential claims and that they are in principle valid so long as they are brought within the relevant time limits resolves the position with regard to self assessment claims.\\nAs already stated, it is common ground that all the self assessment claims are in time, so that it follows that, at any rate in my opinion, those claims can in principle be pursued.\\nThe position of the pay and file claims is different.\\nAs the UT observed at para 156, it was said that it was not until the judgment of the ECJ in December 2005 that M&S could have anticipated that a test such as the no possibilities test would be introduced.\\nAccordingly, M&S should not only be given time after the decision to make its claim, it should be given time to put itself into a position where it could make an effective claim.\\nIt was said that M&S should have been given time, say, to put the surrendering companies into liquidation and to have them dissolved.\\nHowever, the UT rejected that argument.\\nThey held that the principle of effectiveness is concerned with giving effect to Community rights.\\nIt is concerned with ensuring that such rights as a person has under Community law are recognised and given effect to in a member state which has not properly reflected such rights in its own domestic law.\\nIt was no part of that principle that a person should be given the opportunity to bring about a new state of affairs giving rise to the existence of new rights which he does not already have, in order to enforce them under Community law when they would be unenforceable under domestic law.\\nIn those circumstances, the principle of effectiveness could not be invoked since there was no right under Community law in respect of which a claim could be made within the time limit and, for reasons the UT had given in para 158, it is not part of the principle of effectiveness that a company must be given an opportunity to create a new situation so as to allow it to assert a right which it would not otherwise have.\\nThat analysis seems to me to be correct.\\nIt was accepted by Moses LJ in para 63 of his judgment in the Court of Appeal, where he added that a period of six years and three months was reasonable.\\nHe then discussed the problem in some detail between paras 63 and 68.\\nHe set out the differing conclusions of the FTT and UT in paras 64 and 65 respectively and in para 66 he noted (a) that the relevant jurisprudence establishes that a Member State may impose a reasonable time limit in the interests of legal certainty: Aprile Srl v Amministrazione delle Finanze dello Stato (No 2) (Case C 228/96) [2001] 1 WLR 126, [1998] ECR 1 7141 at para 19 and Fleming (trading as Bodycraft) v Revenue and Customs Comrs [2008] 1 WLR 195 at para 79(a) and (b) that such a time limit must not render virtually impossible or excessively difficult the exercise of rights conferred by Community law: Aprile at para 19.\\nHe concluded, in my opinion correctly, that the line of cases concerned with the reduction of a time limit which has the effect of taking a right away without adequate transitional arrangements, as for example Case C 62/00, Marks & Spencer plc v Customs and Excise Comrs (M&S 1) [2003] QB 866) has no relevance to these claims.\\nAs he explained, the time limit of 6 years and 3 months was in place, M&Ss claims were made within that period and were found not to have satisfied the paragraph 55 conditions.\\nMoses LJ recognised at para 67 that M&S could not have foreseen the contents of para 55 of the ECJ judgment but held that the critical question was whether at the expiry of the time limit for making a claim M&S had a right to claim the MSG losses.\\nHe then expressed his conclusion in para 68 thus: At the time M&S made its claim to the losses sustained by MSG, it had no community law right to make such a claim.\\nThe prohibition against such a claim was lawful because M&S did not satisfy the conditions identified by the ECJ in paragraph 55.\\nThe ECJ has espoused the principle that, provided that the time limits are not discriminatory and do not render the exercise of Community law rights virtually impossible or excessively difficult in practice, a Member State may lay down reasonable time limits even if their effect is to deprive a claimant of such a right (Haahr Petroleum v Abenra Havn and Others [(Case C 90/94)] [1997] ECR 1 4085, para 48).\\nThat case concerned, like Aprile and M&S 1, the propriety of a time limit for claims to repayment.\\nThere is no principle that a reasonable time must be afforded to a claimant in which to bring about the circumstances which would generate the Community law right.\\nThe error of the FTT lay in the assumption that M&S had a right at the time it made its claim; on the findings of fact, at that time it had no such right and the principle of effectiveness cannot be invoked to create one.\\nIn my view the Upper Tribunal was correct and the 'pay and file' claim in respect of MSG is time barred.\\nI would uphold the decision of the Upper Tribunal.\\nI agree with that reasoning and would uphold the decision of the UT and the Court of Appeal that, unlike the self assessment claims, the relevant pay and file claims are time barred.\\nThat appears to me to be a sufficient answer to the question relating to those claims raised by issue four.\\nIssue five\\nThis issue asks what is the correct method of calculating the losses available to be surrendered.\\nBefore the FTT (at both the liability and quantum hearings) the essential issue was whether the losses should be calculated (a) under the rules of a single country and, if so, whether it should be a local country (Method A) or the UK (Method C); (b) by converting to UK rules the unutilised losses as determined under local rules (Method E); or (c) by taking the lower each year of the amounts calculated and utilised either under local rules or after conversion to UK rules (Method F).\\nThe FTT held that Method E was the correct method and its decision was upheld by the UT and by the Court of Appeal.\\nHMRC however contend that Method F is correct.\\nThe question in this appeal is thus whether the correct method is E or F.\\nThe essential difference between the methods is this.\\nMethod E begins by applying the local rules to determine whether there is a loss in a particular period and, if so, the amount of the loss that remained unutilised.\\nThe unutilised loss calculated by reference to the local rules is then converted to UK principles.\\nM&S says that this conversion to UK principles ensures that M&S only obtains the same relief as a UK resident group would obtain.\\nSo, for example, if a loss calculated under local rules included a capital (rather than a trading) loss, that loss would be eliminated from the claim on conversion to UK principles because in the UK group relief is only available for trading losses.\\nIt says that the conversion process also ensures that the relief is given in the same year as that in which it would be given to a UK resident group.\\nIn some cases the process of converting the loss to UK principles has the effect of moving the loss from one period to the next.\\nFor example, the whole or part of a loss incurred in Year 1 under local rules may after conversion to UK principles be incurred in Year 0 or Year 2 under UK rules.\\nThis does not involve a permanent difference between the two sets of rules.\\nThe total amount of the loss over the period remains the same but the loss now occurs in Year 0 or 2.\\nM&S say that this is an essential part of ensuring equal treatment.\\nWere the group a UK resident group the loss would occur in those years.\\nM&S says that Method E is to be preferred to Method F because it is the more equitable approach.\\nHMRC, on the other hand, contend that no system of quantification can be permitted which allows a loss to be claimed in a period in which, in Germany no loss was sustained, as for example in 2002.\\nThey say that no principle of EU law requires the German losses to be relieved to a greater extent than would be the case if they were claimed in Germany.\\nLike the UT, the Court of Appeal preferred Method E.\\nIt did so for the reasons concisely put by Moses LJ in paras 86 to 88 of his judgment.\\nI agree with his reasoning and could not put it better.\\nIt is in these terms: 86.\\nM&S seeks to set against its UK profits losses sustained by its subsidiary in Germany, as if those losses were sustained by a subsidiary resident in the UK.\\nIt claims no more and no less.\\nIf the losses had been sustained in the UK, it seems to me that there would be no question of timing differences leading to the loss of relief in respect of a proportion of unutilised losses.\\nThe effect of the application of UK tax rules may be to shift losses sustained in Year 2 under German tax rules into Year 1, if the subsidiary had been resident in the UK.\\nThose losses should be afforded relief in Year 1 under UK rules.\\nIt is nothing to the point that that would not be the appropriate year under German tax rules.\\nThe effect of the application of UK tax rules is to convert the German losses into losses sustained in year 1 to be set against UK profits in the same accounting period, ie year 1.\\nThat is not to cut across UK tax principles but to apply them. 87.\\nThe consequence of the Revenue's method is to deprive M&S of relief for losses sustained in Germany in circumstances where it would not be refused relief had those losses been sustained in the UK.\\nMethod E does not give the parent greater relief than would have been available had its subsidiary been resident in the same state as the parent, whether in Germany or in the UK.\\nIt does not seem to me to matter that the losses are allowed in different accounting periods from those in which they would be allowed in Germany.\\nNo relief is to be afforded to losses which would not be relieved in the UK.\\nAs the FTT put it: Once you move from identifying the local losses (computed under local rules) to identifying their equivalent under UK rules, you also have to move from local time of recognition to UK timing of recognition (para 7) 88.\\nMethod E does not result in a group relief claim for an amount more than could be claimed were the subsidiary to have been resident in the UK.\\nThe re allocation of losses to a different period in the UK is merely the result of the application of UK tax law.\\nI would dismiss the Revenue's appeal on this point.\\nFor the same reasons, I would dismiss the HMRCs appeal under this head.\\nI would answer the question posed by issue five by holding that the correct method of calculating the losses available to be surrendered is Method E.\\nCONCLUSION\\nFor these reasons I would dismiss the appeals of the HMRC on issues 2 and 5 and I would dismiss the appeal of M&S on issue 4.\\nI would answer issue two in the affirmative and would hold that M&S is entitled to advance all its self assessment claims.\\nUnder issue 4, I would hold that the relevant pay and file claims are time barred, as contended for by the HMRC.\\nFinally, under issue five, I would hold that the correct method of calculation of the claims is Method E.\\nI would like to conclude by saying how much I appreciate the clarity with which all the tribunals and courts have expressed their reasoning and conclusions on the many different points that have confronted them in the light of the jurisprudence of the ECJ.\\nANNEX A STATUTORY FRAMEWORK 1.\\nGroup relief is dealt with in chapter 4 of part X of ICTA 19881.\\nThe basic provisions are section 402(1) and section 403(1), which provide so far as material that: 402 (1) relief for trading losses and other amounts eligible for relief from corporation tax may be surrendered by a company (the surrendering company) and, on the making of a claim by another company (the claimant company), may be allowed to the claimant company by way of a relief from corporation tax called group relief. 403 (1) If in an accounting period (the surrender period) the surrendering company has (a) trading losses, excess capital allowances or a non trading deficit on its loan relationships, or (b) [certain other charges and expenses] which are available for group relief, the amount may, subject to the provisions of this Chapter, be set off for the purposes of corporation tax against the total profits of the claimant company for its corresponding accounting period. (A) The self assessment regime (applicable to accounting periods ending on or after 1 July 1999) 2.\\nPart VIII of Schedule 18 FA 1998 lays down more detailed provisions on claims under the self assessment regime.\\nSo far as is material the relevant provisions are as follows: Claim to be included in company tax return 67(1) A claim for group relief must be made by being included in the claimant company's company tax return for the accounting period for which the claim is made. (2) It may be included in the return originally made or by amendment.\\nContent of claims 68(1) A claim for group relief must specify (a) the amount of relief claimed, and (b) the name of the surrendering company. 1 Post Finance Act 1998 version (2) The amount specified must be an amount which is quantified at the time the claim is made.\\nClaims for more or less than the amount available for surrender 69(1) A claim for group relief may be made for less than the amount available for surrender at the time the claim is made. (2) A claim is ineffective if the amount claimed exceeds the amount available for surrender at the time the claim is made. (3) For these purposes the amount available for surrender at any time is calculated as follows.\\nFirst step Determine the total amount available for surrender under section 403 of the Taxes Act 1988 (a) on the basis of the information in the company's company tax return, and (b) disregarding any amendments whose effect is deferred under paragraph 31(3).\\nSecond step Then deduct the total of all amounts for which notices of consent have been given by the company and not withdrawn.\\nConsent to surrender 70(1) A claim for group relief requires the consent of the surrendering company. (2) (3) The necessary consent or consents must be given (a) by notice in writing, (b) to the officer of the Board to whom the surrendering company makes its company tax returns, (c) at or before the time the claim is made.\\nOtherwise the claim is ineffective. (4) A claim for group relief is ineffective unless it is accompanied by a copy of the notice of consent to surrender given by the surrendering company. (5) Notice of consent 71(1) Notice of consent by the surrendering company must contain all the following details (a) the name of the surrendering company; (b) the name of the company to which relief is being surrendered; (c) the amount of relief being surrendered; (d) the accounting period of the surrendering company to which the surrender relates; (e) the tax district references of the surrendering company and the company to which relief is being surrendered.\\nOtherwise the notice is ineffective. (2) Notice of consent may not be amended, but it may be withdrawn and replaced by another notice of consent. (3) Notice of consent may be withdrawn by notice to the officer of the Board to whom the notice of consent was given. (4) Except where the consent is withdrawn under paragraph 75 (withdrawal in consequence of reduction of amount available for surrender), the notice of withdrawal must be accompanied by a notice signifying the consent of the claimant company to the withdrawal.\\nOtherwise the notice is ineffective. (5) The claimant company must, so far as it may do so, amend its company tax return for the accounting period for which the claim was made so as to reflect the withdrawal of consent.\\nNotice of consent requiring amendment of return 72(1) Where notice of consent by the surrendering company is given after the company has made a company tax return for the period to which the surrender relates, the surrendering company must at the same time amend its return so as to reflect the notice of consent. (2) Where notice of consent by the surrendering company relates to a loss in respect of which relief has been given under section 393(1) of the Taxes Act 1988 (carry forward of trading losses), the surrendering company must at the same time amend its company tax return for the period or, if more than one, each of the periods in which relief for that loss has been given under section 393(1) so as to reflect the new notice of consent.\\nFor this purpose relief under section 393(1) is treated as given for losses incurred in earlier accounting periods before losses incurred in later accounting periods. (3) The time limits otherwise applicable to amendment of a company tax return do not prevent an amendment being made under sub paragraph (1) or (2). (4) If the surrendering company fails to comply with sub paragraph (1) or (2), the notice of consent is ineffective.\\nWithdrawal or amendment of claim 73(1) A claim for group relief may be withdrawn by the claimant company only by amending its company tax return. (2) A claim for group relief may not be amended, but must be withdrawn and replaced by another claim.\\nTime limit for claims [See under (B) below] Reduction in amount available for surrender 75(1) This paragraph applies if, after the surrendering company has given one or more notices of consent to surrender, the total amount available for surrender is reduced to less than the amount stated in the notice, or the total of the amounts stated in the notices, as being surrendered. (2) The company must within 30 days withdraw the notice of consent, or as many of the notices as is necessary to bring the total amount surrendered within the new total amount available for surrender, and may give one or more new notices of consent. (3) The company must give notice in writing of the withdrawal of consent, and send a copy of any new notice of consent (a) to each of the companies affected, and (b) to the Inland Revenue. (4) If the surrendering company fails to act in accordance with sub paragraph (2), the Inland Revenue may by notice to the surrendering company give such directions as they think fit as to which notice or notices are to be ineffective or are to have effect in a lesser amount.\\nThis power shall not be exercised to any greater extent than is necessary to secure that the total amount stated in the notice or notices is consistent with the total amount available for surrender. (5) The Inland Revenue must at the same time send a copy of the notice to the claimant company, or each claimant company, affected by their action. (6) A claimant company which receives (a) notice of the withdrawal of consent, or a copy of a new notice of consent, under sub paragraph (3), or (b) a copy of a notice containing directions by the Inland Revenue under sub paragraph (4), must, so far as it may do so, amend its company tax return for the accounting period for which the claim is made so that it is consistent with the new position with regard to consent to surrender. (B) Time limits 3.\\nThe time limits for making group relief claims under the self assessment regime are set out at paragraph 74(1) of Schedule 18 to FA 1998 as follows: (1) A claim for group relief may be made or withdrawn at any time up to whichever is the last of the following dates (a) the first anniversary of the filing date for the company tax return of the claimant company for the accounting period for which the claim is made; (b) if notice of enquiry is given into that return, 30 days after the enquiry is completed; (c) if after such an enquiry [an officer of Revenue and Customs] [amends] the return under paragraph 34(2), 30 days after notice of the amendment is issued; (d) if an appeal is brought against such an amendment, 30 days after the date on which the appeal is finally determined. (2) A claim for group relief may be made or withdrawn at a later time if the Inland Revenue allow it. (C) Pay and file regime 4.\\nThe procedural requirements for making group relief claims for accounting periods ending before 1st July 1999 (the pay and File years) are set out in Schedule 17A ICTA 1988, paragraphs 2 to 5 of which provide: 2(1) No claim for an accounting period of a company may be made if (a) the company has been assessed to corporation tax for the period, and (b) the assessment has become final and conclusive. (2) Sub paragraph (1) above shall not apply in the case of a claim made before the end of 2 years from the end of the period. (3) This paragraph applies to the withdrawal of a claim as it applies to the making of a claim. 3(1) No claim for an accounting period of a company may be made after the end of 6 years from the end of the period, except under paragraph 5 below. (2) This paragraph applies to the withdrawal of a claim as it applies to the making of a claim. 4 Where under paragraph 2 or 3 above a claim may not be made after a certain time, it may be made within such further time as the Board may allow. 5(1) A claim for an accounting period of a company may be made after the end of 6 years from the end of the period if (a) the company has been assessed to corporation tax for the period before the end of 6 years from the end of the period, (b) the company has appealed against the assessment, and (c) the assessment has not become final and conclusive. (2) No claim for an accounting period of a company may be made after the end of 6 years and 3 months from the end of the period.\\nEaster Term [2013] UKSC 30 On appeal from: [2011] EWCA Civ 1156 JUDGMENT (Appellant) Commissioners for Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (Respondent) v Marks and Spencer plc Commissioners for Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (Appellant) v Marks and Spencer plc (Respondent) before Lord Neuberger, President Lord Hope, Deputy President JUDGMENT GIVEN ON Lord Mance Lord Reed Lord Carnwath 22 May 2013 Heard on 15 April 2013 Appellant David Milne QC Nicola Shaw QC (Instructed by Hage Aaronson Ltd) Appellant David Ewart QC Sarah Ford (Instructed by HMRC Solicitors Office) Respondent David Ewart QC Sarah Ford (Instructed by HMRC Solicitors Office) Respondent David Milne QC Nicola Shaw QC (Instructed by Hage Aaronson Ltd) LORD HOPE (with whom Lord Neuberger, Lord Mance, Lord Reed and Lord Carnwath agree) 1.\\nThis litigation concerns claims by Marks and Spencer plc (M&S) for group relief in respect of losses sustained by two of their subsidiaries: Marks and Spencer (Deutschland) GmbH (MSD), which was resident in Germany; and Marks and Spencer (Belgium) NV (MSB), which was resident in Belgium.\\nThe claims were originally made and refused by the Revenue (HMRC) more than ten years ago.\\nThey raise questions about the availability of cross border group relief and the method of quantifying such relief as is available which, despite having been the subject of nine separate hearings since the case was first considered in December 2002, have still not yet been resolved. 2.\\nThe appeals come before the Court at this stage on an application by M&S for a reference to the Court of Justice of the European Communities.\\nOn 14 October 2011 the Court of Appeal gave judgment on five issues which had been identified as arising in the case: Marks and Spencer plc v Revenue and Customs Commissioners [2011] EWCA Civ 1156, [2012] STC 231.\\nThe Court of Appeal found in favour of M&S on four of these issues and in favour of HMRC on the other one.\\nIt gave the parties permission to appeal on all issues.\\nM&S had intended to seek a reference on the first issue, but on 21 February 2013 the CJEU gave judgment in Case C 123/11 Proceedings brought by A Oy.\\nM&S submit that any doubt that might have existed on the first issue has been dispelled by that ruling, that a reference is no longer necessary and that it can now be answered in their favour.\\nHMRC had objected to M&Ss application for a preliminary ruling on the ground that the answer to the first issue was already clear.\\nAs matters now stand, however, they simply invite this Court to determine this issue in their favour.\\nSo the hearing on M&Ss application for a reference became a substantive hearing of the appeal on the first issue.\\nBackground 3.\\nM&S began to expand its business into other countries in 1975.\\nBy the end of the 1990s it had sales outlets in more than 34 countries, with a network of subsidiaries and franchises.\\nBut by that date it had already begun to incur losses, and in March 2001 it decided to withdraw from its continental European activity.\\nIt was able to sell its French and Spanish subsidiaries to third parties, but no purchasers could be found for MSD and MSB.\\nMSD ceased trading in August 2001 and was dissolved following liquidation on 14 December 2007.\\nMSB ceased trading on 22 December 2001 and was dissolved following liquidation on 27 December 2007. 4.\\nThe first group relief claims were made between 2000 and 2003 at a time when neither subsidiary was in liquidation.\\nThey concerned MSDs losses for the years 1998 to 2001 and MSBs losses for the years 2001 and 2002.\\nClaims for the same losses by the same companies for the same years were made on three subsequent occasions in response to what M&S describe as factual and jurisprudential developments: on 20 March 2007, when both companies were in liquidation; on 12 December 2007, just before the companies were dissolved; and on 11 June 2008, on behalf of MSB following the dissolution of that company.\\nThe claims for the years from 2000 onwards were governed by the self assessment rules in Schedule 18 to the Finance Act 1998 and were within the statutory time limits.\\nHMRC maintain that the claims for years prior to 2000, which were governed by the corporation tax pay and file rules in Schedule 17A to the Taxes Act 1988, were out of time when they were included in the claims that were made on the three occasions subsequent to the making of the first claims between 2000 and 2003. 5.\\nThe basic contention underlying all these claims was that the provisions in United Kingdom legislation which restricted group relief claims to losses of UK resident companies and, after the Finance Act 2000, losses of UK branches of non resident companies were contrary to article 43 EC (now article 49 TFEU) on the freedom of establishment, and were thus unlawful.\\nOn 17 December 2002 the Special Commissioners held that there had been no breach of that article: Marks and Spencer plc v Halsey (Inspector of Taxes) [2003] STC (SCD) 70.\\nPark J on appeal decided to refer the matter to the ECJ: [2003] EWHC 1945 (Ch).\\nHe sought a preliminary ruling on two questions.\\nThe first was the compatibility of the UK provisions with article 43 EC.\\nThe second was what difference the facts of M&Ss case might make to the answer to the first question. 6.\\nThe ECJ gave its ruling in its judgment of 13 December 2005: Case C 446/03 Marks & Spencer plc v David Halsey (Her Majestys Inspector of Taxes) [2005] ECR I 10837.\\nIt ruled that the answer to the first question was that article 43 EC did not preclude provisions of a Member State which prevented a resident parent company from claiming group relief for losses incurred by a subsidiary established in another Member State.\\nThe restriction was justified by three grounds when taken together: preserving the balanced allocation of the power to impose taxes between Member States; preventing losses being taken into account twice in different Member States; and preventing the risk of tax avoidance if the taxpayer were to be free to choose the Member State in which to claim relief: paras 42 51. 7.\\nAs to the proportionality of the restriction, however, the ECJ went on to say this: 55 In that regard, the Court considers that the restrictive measure at issue in the main proceedings goes beyond what is necessary to attain the essential part of the objectives pursued where: the non resident subsidiary has exhausted the possibilities available in its State of residence of having the losses taken into account for the accounting period concerned by the claim for relief and also for previous accounting periods, if necessary by transferring those losses to a third party or by offsetting the losses against the profits made by the subsidiary in previous periods, and there is no possibility for the foreign subsidiarys losses to be taken into account in its state of residence for future periods either by the subsidiary itself or by a third party, in particular where the subsidiary has been sold to that third party. 8.\\nThe debate then returned to the United Kingdom.\\nPark J gave effect to the ruling of the ECJ on 10 April 2006: Marks and Spencer plc v Halsey (Inspector of Taxes) [2006] EWHC 811 (Ch), [2006] STC 1235.\\nHe held that the no possibilities test referred to in para 55 of the ECJs judgment required an analysis of the recognised possibilities legally available given the objective facts of the companys situation at the relevant time, and that the test was to be applied at the date when the group relief claim was made.\\nHe remitted the case to the Special Commissioners, but both parties appealed against his decision.\\nThe Court of Appeal upheld the judges findings: [2007] EWCA Civ 117, [2008] STC 526.\\nThe case then returned to the Tax Chamber of the First Tier Tribunal: Marks and Spencer plc v Revenue and Customs Commissioners [2009] UKFTT 64 (TC); [2009] UKFTT 231 (TC); [2009] SFTD 757, and proceeded from there to the Upper Tribunal [2010] UKUT 213 (TCC), [2010] STC 2470 and then to a second Court of Appeal, whose decisions are now under appeal to this court. 9.\\nThe issues that arose in the second Court of Appeal were summarised by Moses LJ in [2012] STC 231, para 4 as follows: (i) Is the test that the ECJ established to identify those circumstances in which it would be unlawful to preclude cross border relief for losses, the no possibilities test, to be applied (as the Revenue contend) at the end of the accounting period in which the losses crystallised rather than (as M&S contends) the date of claim? This question involves deciding whether the Court of Appeal in the first appeal reached a binding decision on that issue and whether it remains binding on this court in light of subsequent decisions of the ECJ. (ii) Can sequential/cumulative claims be made (as M&S contends) by the same company for the same losses of the same surrendering company in respect of the same accounting period? The Revenue assert that that is not a question decided by the Court of Appeal and is precluded both by UK fiscal rules and by the underlying jurisprudence of the ECJ. (iii) If a surrendering company has some losses which it has or can utilise and others which it cannot, does the no possibilities test (as the Revenue contend) preclude transfer of that proportion of the losses which it has no possibility of using? (iv) Does the principle of effectiveness require M&S to be allowed to make fresh pay and file claims now that the ECJ has identified the circumstances in which losses may be transferred cross border, when at the time M&S made those claims there was no means of foreseeing the test established by the court? (v) What is the correct method of calculating the losses available to be transferred? 10.\\nThe Court of Appeal refused HMRCs appeal on the first, second, third and fifth issues.\\nIt refused M&Ss appeal on the fourth issue.\\nAs both parties sought and obtained permission to appeal to this court, all five issues remain to be decided.\\nThey have been re stated in a slightly amended form in the statement of facts and issues.\\nFor present purposes only the first issue need be set out here.\\nIt is in these terms: In Case C 446/03 Marks & Spencer v Halsey, did the ECJ decide that it was contrary to article 43 EC to preclude cross border loss relief in the Member State of the claimant company (a) only where the taxpayer can show, on the basis of the circumstances existing at the end of the accounting period in which the losses in question arose, that there was no possibility of the losses in question being utilised in the Member State of the surrendering company in that accounting period, in any previous accounting period or in future accounting periods (as HMRC contend), or (b) where the taxpayer can show, on the basis of the circumstances existing at the date of the claim, that there has been no possibility of utilising the losses in the Member State of the surrendering company in any accounting period prior to the date of the claim and no possibility of such utilisation in the accounting period in which the claim is made or in future accounting periods (as M&S contend)? Issue 1 in the courts below 11.\\nThe question which Park J had to resolve, when the case returned to him after the ECJ had given its ruling, was whether the facts by reference to which the conditions set out in para 55 had to be satisfied were those which existed or could be foreseen at the end of the accounting period in which the losses arose, or those which existed at the date of the claim.\\nHe held that the relevant time was the date of the claim: [2006] STC 1235, paras 44 46.\\nHe said that the end of the accounting period was too soon.\\nIt would be likely to rule out virtually every case.\\nHe found it hard to imagine any case in which German or Belgian law would not provide for some possibility of relief for the losses at the end of an accounting period in which MSD or MSB made a loss and was still carrying on its trade.\\nThe date of the claim provided a rational basis for applying para 55, and if a company claimed group relief at a time when those criteria are satisfied it should get the relief. 12.\\nThe first Court of Appeal also held that the relevant time was the date when the claim was made: [2008] STC 526, para 32 42.\\nChadwick LJ said in para 36 that he could find no support in the reasoning which underlay the approach of the ECJ for the proposition that the para 55 conditions must be satisfied at the end of the surrender period: It is important to keep in mind, as it seems to me, that the question whether the United Kingdom tax authorities are precluded by Community law from applying the restriction on group relief imposed by domestic law does not arise until a claim for group relief is made by the claimant company.\\nThe claim must be accompanied by a notice from the surrendering company.\\nAt the least the surrendering company must consent to the use of its losses by the claimant company; and (as I have said) it may well be that the claimant company can be required to provide some formal confirmation from the surrendering company that the losses are not available in its state of residence.\\nThe question whether the United Kingdom tax authorities are precluded by Community law from applying the restriction on group relief imposed by domestic law turns on whether the para 55 conditions are satisfied.\\nI can see no reason in principle why the latter question whether the para 55 conditions are satisfied should not be answered by reference to the facts as they are when the former question arises. 13.\\nThe second Court of Appeal did not agree: [2012] STC 231.\\nMoses LJ said in para 29 that the principled objection to allowing the question whether the para 55 conditions are satisfied to be answered by reference to the facts as they are at the time of the claim is that it gives an option or choice as to where the losses may be relieved, and that that option was recognised by the ECJ as substantially jeopardising fiscal sovereignty.\\nIn other words, the claimant company should not be given an opportunity to take steps that might bring about a situation in which it could make a cross border claim.\\nPlacing the relevant moment at the end of the accounting period in which the losses were made denied it that opportunity.\\nIn paras 30 and 31 he gave further reasons for disagreeing with the reasoning of Park J and the first Court of Appeal.\\nBut in para 33 he recognised that there was a question as to whether it was open to his court to do so.\\nHMRC contended that it was open to his court to depart from the decision in the first Court of Appeal because subsequent decisions of the ECJ demonstrated that it fell into error, and that his court should follow those subsequent decisions. 14.\\nMoses LJ said that he was more than happy to follow the approach of Chadwick LJ in Cond Nast Publications Ltd v Customs and Excise [2006] EWCA Civ 976; [2006] STC 1721, para 44, that the Court of Appeal could refuse to follow its own earlier decision where the judgment of the ECJ under consideration in the earlier case had been the subject of further consideration, and consequent interpretation, explanation or qualification, by the Court in a later judgment.\\nBut he was unable to find anything in Case C 231/05 Proceedings brought by Oy AA [2007] ECR I 6373; [2008] STC 991 or Lidl Belgium GmbH & Co KG v Finanzamt Heilbronn Case C 414/06 [2008] ECR I 3601; [2008] STC 3229 which followed the ruling in Marks & Spencer v Halsey that suggested that the Court thought that it was departing from or going beyond what it had previously decided, although it had every opportunity to do so.\\nHe concluded therefore that his court was bound by the decision of the first Court of Appeal, and that its decision as to the date for assessment of the para 55 conditions was binding on his court: paras 46 48.\\nThe subsequent cases in the Court of Justice 15.\\nIn Oy AA [2007] ECR I 6373 a Finnish parent company wished, for non fiscal and genuine commercial reasons, to support an ailing subsidiary which was established in the United Kingdom by transferring profits to secure its financial position.\\nThe question was whether it could deduct those transfers from its taxable income in Finland.\\nFinnish law limited a companys right to make intra group transfers from its taxable business income to cases where a national parent company holds at least nine tenths of the shares of another national company.\\nThe ECJ said that restricting the deductibility of intra group transfers in this way was apt to safeguard the allocation of powers to impose taxes between Member States, and to combat tax avoidance by deliberately transferring income by means of intra group transfers to companies resident in low taxation jurisdictions.\\nIt ensured that profits earned by group companies in Finland were subject to taxation there according to the principle of territoriality: para 65. 16.\\nTwo of the three justifications referred to in para 51 of Marks & Spencer were therefore satisfied.\\nSafeguarding the allocation of the power to impose taxes could not be achieved by a corresponding, less restrictive national provision, and the law in question was proportionate.\\nSo article 43 EC did not preclude a system such as that in issue in that case: para 67.\\nThere is nothing in this ruling that departs from, or modifies, the justifications referred to in Marks & Spencer or its view in para 46, which it repeated in para 55 of Oy AA, that to give companies the option to have their losses taken into account in the Member State in which they are established or in another Member State would significantly jeopardise a balanced allocation of power to impose taxes between Member States. 17.\\nIn Lidl Belgium GmbH & Co KG [2008] ECR I 3601 the parent company, Lidl Belgium, was resident in Germany and had a permanent establishment in Luxembourg.\\nIts permanent establishment incurred a loss which the parent company sought to deduct from its tax base in Germany.\\nThis was contrary to German law, as the permanent establishment was not subject to taxation in Germany.\\nThe question was whether the national tax regime was precluded by article 43 EC.\\nThe Court followed the same approach as it had adopted in Marks & Spencer and Oy AA.\\nAs in Oy AA, it held that the national legislation could be justified by the need to safeguard the allocation of power to tax between the Member States and the need to prevent tax avoidance: para 41.\\nIt recognised, as it did in Marks & Spencer, para 55, that a measure which restricted the freedom of establishment goes beyond what is necessary to obtain the objectives pursued where a non resident subsidiary has exhausted the possibilities for having the losses incurred in the Member State where it is situated taken into account for the accounting period concerned and previous accounting periods, and where there is no possibility for that subsidiarys loss to be taken into account in that State for future periods.\\nBut Luxembourg tax legislation provided for the possibility of deducting a taxpayers losses in future tax years, and the claimant had not shown that the conditions laid down in para 55 of Marks & Spencer were satisfied. 18.\\nHere again there is a straightforward application of the principles established by Marks & Spencer.\\nOnce again the Court recognised the legitimate interest which the Member States have in preventing conduct which is liable to undermine the right to exercise the powers of taxation which are vested in them, and that to give a company the right to elect to have its losses taken into account in the Member State in which it has its seat or in another Member State would seriously undermine a balanced allocation of the power to impose taxes between the Member States concerned.\\nIn Case C 337/08 X Holding BV v Staatssecretaris van Financin [2010] ECR I 01215 a tax scheme which permitted a parent company to form a single tax entity with its resident subsidiary, but prevented it from doing this with a non resident subsidiary, was held to be justified on the application of the principles established in Marks & Spencer and applied in Oy AA and Lidl.\\nAs Moses LJ found when he examined these cases in the Court of Appeal, there is nothing in them which assists, either one way or the other, in the determination of the question raised by the first issue. 19.\\nMoses LJ did not, of course, have the benefit of considering the Courts judgment of 21 February 2013 in A Oy.\\nIt is this judgment which is said by M&S to confirm the soundness of their submission that the question whether cross border relief in the Member State of the claimant company is precluded should be determined on the basis of the circumstances existing at the date of the claim and not at the end of the accounting period in which the losses arose.\\nThey say that it shows that the contrary view by Moses LJ is no longer tenable.\\nA Oy 20.\\nA was a Finnish undertaking with a subsidiary in Sweden, referred to as B. Following trading losses, B closed its sales outlets but remained bound by two long term leases.\\nA planned to merge with B for reasons that could be justified commercially and to make it possible for Bs leases to be transferred to A.\\nThe effect of that operation would be that the assets, liabilities and residual obligations of B would be transferred to A and that the Finnish parent would no longer have a subsidiary in Sweden.\\nA sought an advance decision as to whether, once the operation had been carried out, it would be able to deduct Bs losses in accordance with the Finnish law on income tax.\\nWhen it received a negative answer it sought a preliminary ruling from the CJEU on the question whether article 49 TFEU, as it now is, precluded legislation under which that deduction could not be made while allowing for that possibility if the merger was with a resident subsidiary. 21.\\nAdvocate General Kokott was of the opinion that further development of the courts case law since Marks & Spencer had altered the scope of the justifications referred to in that judgment, that they could be referred to for examining the need for a national measure only if the prevention of double use of losses was recognised as an independent justification, that a justification based on the allocation of taxation powers among the Member States alone was no longer appropriate and that the possibility that the Swedish subsidiary might have its accumulated losses taken into account in its State of residence was irrelevant: paras 47 54.\\nBut she went on nevertheless in paras 55 59 to consider whether the conditions in Marks & Spencer for the losses of a non resident subsidiary to be taken into account in the parent companys Member State were fulfilled. 22.\\nIn her opinion the Marks & Spencer exception was formulated very restrictively, so that there must be no possibility for the foreign subsidiarys losses to be taken into account in its State of residence for past or future periods either by itself or a third party.\\nIn A Oys case the merger arose from a free decision of the parent company.\\nThe taxable company still had the option of using the Swedish losses in the future by resuming trading and through the resulting profits.\\nCessation of trading raised the possibility of choosing the tax scheme applicable to those losses which, according to the courts case law, the taxable company did not have.\\nThe Finnish provision was necessary for attaining the objective of preserving the allocation of taxing powers among Member States, and the disadvantages it caused were reasonably proportionate: para 68. 23.\\nThe Court did not follow either of the two approaches indicated by the Advocate General.\\nThe task which it set itself was to consider whether the difference in treatment between resident and non resident companies was appropriate for ensuring the objective pursued and did not go beyond what was necessary to achieve that objective: para 39.\\nIt considered all three of the justifications referred to in para 43 of Marks & Spencer taken together, and concluded that the legislation pursued legitimate objectives compatible with the Treaty which were justified by overriding interests in the public interest: paras 40 46.\\nIt then turned in para 48 to the question whether the legislation was necessary to attain those objectives: 48.\\nWith respect to the proportionality of the obstacle to freedom of establishment, it must be observed, first, that granting the parent company the possibility of taking into account the losses of its non resident subsidiary in connection with a cross border merger is not a priori such as to allow the parent company to choose freely from one year to the next the tax scheme applicable to the subsidiarys losses (see, a contrario, X Holding, para 31). 49.\\nIt follows, secondly, from the courts case law that a restrictive measure such as that at issue in the main proceedings goes beyond what is necessary to attain the essential part of the objectives pursued in a situation in which the non resident subsidiary has exhausted the possibilities available in its State of residence of having the losses taken into account (see, to that effect, Marks & Spencer, para 55).\\nIt is for the parent company to show that that is the case (see, to that effect, Marks & Spencer, para 56). 24.\\nAs for the facts of that case, As argument was that, once the merger had been carried out, B would be liquidated and A would no longer have a subsidiary or permanent establishment in Sweden.\\nSo neither of those two companies would appear to have the possibility of relying in Sweden, after the merger, on the losses incurred in Sweden before the merger.\\nThe Courts response to this argument in para 52 was that those specific circumstances were not in themselves capable of showing that there was no possibility of taking into account the losses that exist in the subsidiarys State of residence: 53.\\nThus several Member States which have intervened in the case consider, on the contrary, that the possibility of taking Bs losses into account in Sweden continues to exist.\\nThe German Government submits that those losses can be deducted from the income, admittedly very small, which B continues to receive in Sweden.\\nIt adds that B is still involved in leases which could be assigned.\\nThe French Government also submits that Swedish law allows companies to take losses into account in previous tax years or on the occasion of the taxation of capital gains made on the assets and liabilities of the merged company.\\nThe Italian Government submits that Sweden is entitled to evaluate the assets transferred and to tax the merged company on the profit thus realised. 54.\\nIt is therefore for the national court to determine whether A has in fact proved that B has exhausted all the possibilities of taking account of the losses which exist in Sweden. 25.\\nThe Court observed in para 55 that, were the referring court to reach the conclusion that such proof had been produced, denial to A of the possibility of deducting from its taxable profits the losses incurred by its non resident subsidiary, in the context of the proposed merger, would be contrary to articles 49 TFEU and 56 TFEU.\\nIt held in para 56 that those articles did not preclude national legislation to that effect.\\nBut it added this qualification: Such national legislation is none the less incompatible with European Union law if it does not allow the parent company the possibility of showing that its non resident subsidiary has exhausted the possibilities of taking those losses into account and that there is no possibility of their being taken into account in its State of residence in respect of future tax years either by itself or by a third party. 26.\\nM&S submit that there are several points in this judgment that are relevant to the first issue.\\nFirst, it held that the fact that A exercised a free choice in undertaking the merger did not preclude relief: para 48.\\nIn other words, the principle that a taxpayer should not be able to choose the country in which to relieve losses does not extend to steps which pose no threat to an entitlement to cross border relief.\\nSteps which are taken simply in order to show that the para 55 conditions are met do not threaten the balanced allocation of taxing powers.\\nSecondly, the judgment suggests that the mere fact that losses could be carried forward under local law at the end of the accounting period does not of itself mean that the para 55 conditions are not met.\\nReference was made to this possibility in para 50 of the judgment, but this did not lead to a conclusion that the para 55 conditions were not met.\\nIt was still necessary for the national court to examine whether, on the facts, all possibilities of using the losses had been exhausted: para 54.\\nThat being so, there was no principled reason for insisting that the relevant date should be the end of the accounting period in which the losses were incurred.\\nDiscussion 27.\\nThe point which the first issue raises comes down, in the end, to a choice between what Moses LJ described as the principled approach contended for by HMRC and the one contended for by M&S. The approach for which M&S contend looks instead to the practical consequences if the relevant date is to be taken to be the end of the accounting period in which the losses in question arose.\\nPark J identified the objection to HMRCs approach in the judgment which he delivered when the case returned to him after the ECJ had given its ruling: [2006] STC 1235, para 46.\\nHe said that the end of the accounting period was too soon.\\nAs he saw it, the choice of that date would be likely to rule out virtually every case.\\nSo he held that it should be the date when the claim was made.\\nOn the other hand, there is Moses LJs point that to prefer the date of the claim would afford the claimant company the opportunity to bring about a situation in which the para 55 conditions would be satisfied.\\nThat would mean that in the period up to the appeal the claimant would be free to choose whether to bring about a situation in which the losses could be transferred cross border: [2012] STC 231, para 30.\\nThe CJEUs judgment in A Oy has made it easier to decide between the two alternatives. 28.\\nMr Ewart QC for HMRC said that giving the claimant a choice, for whatever reason, as to where its profits were to be taxed would upset the balanced allocation of the power to impose taxes.\\nThat was the critical justification for the rule in Marks & Spencer that provisions of the kind in issue were not precluded by Community law.\\nM&S had not shown that there was any principled reason for selecting the date of the claim.\\nTo choose that date would open up the possibility of choice as to where to seek relief for losses that crystallised in the accounting period.\\nA line had to be drawn somewhere, and the date to which to look was the date when the loss crystallised.\\nA Oy had to be approached with caution, as it was a pre transaction case.\\nIn any event the balanced allocation rule was not just about tax avoidance.\\nTo allow losses to be brought in from another Member State was bound to upset that balance.\\nIt would require a quite extreme case to justify upsetting that balance, and voluntary acts such as liquidation after the loss had crystallised should be excluded. 29.\\nMr Milne QC for M&S did not dispute the need to avoid upsetting the balanced allocation of the power to impose taxes.\\nHe agreed that the para 55 conditions were designed to ensure that there was no double use of the claim for relief.\\nThe questions that had to be addressed were essentially practical questions.\\nIt was a factual exercise.\\nDuring the course of the hearing he altered his position as to the date as at which the entitlement to relief was to be determined.\\nIn its written case M&S said that the most obvious date was, as Chadwick LJ held, the date of the claim.\\nBut Mr Milne suggested that the facts should be examined at the time when the question was asked, which was the date when the claim was being scrutinised.\\nA Oy had clarified the landscape.\\nThe Advocate Generals approach was very similar to that of Moses LJ, but that was not what the CJEU decided.\\nThe facts of the case showed that B was involved in leases that could still be assigned, so there were assets that could be realised.\\nYet the Court still left it to the national court to determine whether A had in fact proved that B had exhausted all the possibilities of taking account of the losses and that there was no possibility of their being taken into account in respect of future tax years: paras 54, 56.\\nThat was best done, said Mr Milne, by looking to the facts as they were at the date of the first instance hearing. 30.\\nI agree with Mr Milne that the exercise that is to be carried out is essentially a factual one, and the claimant company ought to be given an opportunity to deal with it in as realistic a manner as possible.\\nThe approach contended for by HMRC would mean that there would be no realistic chance of satisfying the para 55 conditions at all.\\nIt would hardly ever be possible, if regard is had only to how matters stood at the end of the relevant accounting period, to exclude entirely the possibility that the losses in question might be utilised in the Member State of the surrendering company unless, of course, this was prevented by its local law.\\nThe balanced allocation principle does not require to be supported by an approach which restricts the claimant company to that extent.\\nThis is made clear by the way the issue was dealt with in A Oy: see para 48. 31.\\nThe use of the present tense in the Courts description of the matters to be determined by the national court in paras 54 and 56 might be taken as suggesting that the facts that are to be examined are the facts as they are at the date of the inquiry.\\nBut they are equally consistent with the proposition that, while the date of the inquiry is the date when the facts are being considered, the date as at which they are to be taken to be established is the date when the proceedings are commenced.\\nMr Milne did not present any detailed argument for preferring the date of the inquiry to the date that both Park J and the first Court of Appeal held to be the correct date, which was the date of the claim.\\nThe First Tier Tribunal at [2009] UKFTT 64 (TC), para 42 and the Upper Tribunal at [2010] STC 2470, paras 56 57 took the same view, holding that the date of the claim was appropriate in relation to the pay and file years: see also para 69(2) of Schedule 18 to the Finance Act 1998 which, for self assessment years, uses the phrase at the time the claim is made.\\nThere is no indication in any of these judgments that selecting the date of the claim is likely in practice to give rise to any difficulty.\\nOn the contrary, that date has the advantage of certainty, as the facts to be inquired into will not be susceptible to change between the making of the claim and the commencement of the inquiry.\\nFor these reasons I would reject the choice that Mr Milne made in the course of the hearing and hold that the entitlement to cross border relief is to be examined, as stated in alternative (b) in the first issue, on the basis of the circumstances existing at the date of the claim.\\nThe question whether successive claims can be made, and with what effect, must be left over for consideration under the second issue. 32.\\nThe national court will, of course, be alert to the possibility that the claimant company may simply be choosing in which Member State it should be taxed.\\nThe para 55 conditions are designed to exclude that possibility.\\nBut the judgment in A Oy shows that the mere fact that losses can be carried forward at the end of the accounting period in which they arose does not mean that the para 55 conditions cannot be met.\\nMoreover the fact that the merger that was contemplated in that case was not seen as a ground for denying the possibility of taking the losses into account, on the ground that it allowed the parent company to choose freely from one year to the next the tax scheme applicable to its subsidiarys losses, shows that the decisions to wind up MSD and MSB are not open to objection on that ground either.\\nWhat M&S was doing can be attributed to the fact that the companies had ceased trading six years earlier, and not to the exercise of an option to choose where to seek relief for the losses that had been incurred.\\nThere is no reason to think that what it did must be seen as a threat to the balanced allocation of taxing powers.\\nThe principle that lies behind HMRCs approach must, of course, be respected.\\nBut it does not justify the choice of date for which they contend which, as Park J said, is too soon to give the claimant company a reasonable opportunity of showing that the para 55 conditions are satisfied.\\nConclusion I would answer the first issue by rejecting the alternative contended for 33. by HMRC.\\nI would hold that the question for inquiry is whether the claimant company has been able to show, on the basis of the circumstances known at the date when it makes its claim, that there has been no possibility of the losses in question being utilised in the Member State of the surrendering company in any accounting period prior to the date of the claim and no possibility of such utilisation in the accounting period in which the claim is made or in any future accounting periods.\\nThe consequence of this finding is that the third issue does not need to be answered.\\nThe parties will be heard as to the answers to be given to the three remaining issues at a later date. 56 Where, in one Member State, the resident parent company demonstrates to the tax authorities that those conditions are fulfilled, it is contrary to article 43 EC and 48 EC to preclude the possibility for the parent company to deduct from its taxable profits in that Member State the losses incurred by its non resident subsidiary.\\n\"\n

Process in manufacture or in relation to manufacture implies not only the production but the various stages through which the raw material is subjected to change by different operations.\\nIt is the cumulative effect of the various processes to which the raw materials is subjected to the manufactured product emerges.\\nTherefore, each step towards such production would be a process in relation to manufacture.\\nWhere any particular process is so integrally connected with the ultimate production of goods that but for that process manufacture of processing of goods would be impossible or commercially inexpedient, that process is one in relation to the manufacture.\\n[130 E F).\\n2.1 The natural meaning of the word 'process ' is a mode of treatment of certain materials in order to produce a good result, a species of activity performed on the subject matter in order to transform or reduce it to a certain stage.\\nThere is nothing in the natural meaning of the word 'process ' to exclude its application to handling.\\nThere may be process which consists only in handling and there may be a process which involves no handling or not merely handling but also use.\\nIt may be a process involving the handling of the material and it need not be a process involving the use of material.\\nThe activity may be subordinate but one in relation to the further process of manufacture.\\n[130G, 131 A B] 126 2.2 A process is a manufacturing process when it brings out a complete transformation for the whole compo nents so as to produce a commercially different article or a commodity.\\nBut, that process itself may consist of several processes which may or may not bring about any change at every intermediate stage.\\nBut the activities or the opera tions may be so integrally connected that the final result is the production of a commercially different article.\\nTherefore, any activity or operation which is the essential requirement and is so related to the further operations for the end result would also be a process in or in relation to manufacture to attract the relevant clause in the exemption notification.\\nThe word 'process ' in the context in which it appears in the notification includes an operation or activi ty in relation to manufacture.\\n[132H, 133 A B] J.K.

Singh and Ranjit Kumar for the Respondent in CA.\\n532 of l98O.\\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by CHANDRACHUD, C.J.\\nThese appeals by the State of Maharashtra arise out of a judgment dated February 8, 1980 of the High Court of Bombay in a group of writ petitions which were filed under Article 226 of the Constitution.\\nBy those writ petitions, the petitioners, who are respondents herein, challenged the validity of the Maharashtra Vacant Lands (Prohibition of Unauthorised occupation and Summary Eviction) Act, LXVl of 1975 and the legality of certain orders passed thereunder.\\nWe will refer to the aforesaid 135 Act as \\\"the Act\\\".\\nThe Act replaced an ordinance, bearing a A similar title, which was promulgated by the Governor of Maharashtra on November 11, 1975.\\nThe Act was amended twice, first by Act No. XXXVII of 1976 and then by Act No. VII of 1977.\\nWe will refer to these two these two Acts as 'the First Amendment Act ' and the 'Second Amendment Act '.\\nSeveral writ petitions were filed in the Bombay High Court to challenge the validity of the Act and the orders passed under it, the facts being broadly or the same pattern.\\nIn order to understand the nature of the controversy in these appeals, it would be sufficient for our purpose to set out the facts in one of those petitions, namely Writ Petition No. 1340 of 1977.\\nThe petitioners in that petition are the owners of a plot of land which is part of survey No. 154, Bandra, Greater Bombay admeasuring about 1100 square meters.\\nThough the petitioners had obtained possession of the plot in about .\\n1964 under an agreement of sale, they became owners thereof under an agreement of sale dated September 20, 1974.\\nThe plot is assessed to non agricultural assessment and to property tax by the Bombay Municipal Corporation.\\nThere are four chawls consisting of 31 one room tenements and a two storeyed building having four rooms on each floor on the plot.\\nThese buildings were constructed by the petitioners between 1964 and 1970.\\nThe two storeyed structure is in the occupation of the petitioners while the one room tenements have been let out by them.\\nThese structures having been put up by the petitioners without the requisite permission, the Bombay Municipal Corporation called up them to demolish the same.\\nThereupon, the owners of various plots of land comprised in Survery No. 154 formed an Association through, which they requested the Standing Committee of Bombay Municipal Corporation to regularise the constructions.\\nThe Association was, however, informed that its request could not be granted because, the Government was considering a proposal for the acquisition of the land for the purpose of an industrial estate.\\nThe Association then approached the Special Land Acquisition officer requesting that the land be released from acquisition.\\nThe Land Acquisition officer informed the Association that Survey No 154 had been released from acquisition by a notification dated September 14, 1964.\\nIt would appear from the contentions of the petitioners in the aforesaid writ petition that there are two main tarred roads, two tarred by lanes, two Municipal Primary Schools,one High School 136 and one Municipal dispensary in the area comprised in Plot No. 154.\\nBesides, the head office of the Central Consumer Co operative Society is also situated in one of the buildings situated on that plot of land.\\nThe structure standing on the plot are alleged to be of a permanent nature.\\nIn any event, it seems clear that they are provided with essential civic amenities like water and electricity.\\nThe land belonging to the petitioners was declared by the Competent Authority as \\\"Vacant Land\\\" in exercise of the powers conferred upon it by section 2 (f) (b) of the Act.\\nThe constitutionality of the Act was challenged by the respondents on the ground that it violates the fundamental rights conferred upon them by Articles 14, 19(1) (f) and 51 of the Constitution, that the Legislature lacked the legislative competence to pass the Act and that, the Act delegated excessive and uncanalised powers to the Executive to pass orders under its provisions.\\nThe long title of the Act shows that it was passed in order to prohibit unauthorised occupation of vacant lands in urban areas in the State of Maharashtra and to provide for summary eviction of persons from such lands and for matters connected therewith.\\nAccording to the preamble of the Act, it had become necessary to take certain measures because the number of unauthorised occupants on vacant lands in urban areas was increasing rapidly and was causing grave danger to public health and sanitation and to the peaceful life of the inhabitants of these areas.\\nThe Act was applicable to the entire State of Maharashtra but, in the first instance, it was brought into force in the Bombay Metropolitan Region on November 11, 1975 which was the date on which the ordinance was promulgated.\\nThe Act confers power on the State Government to bring its provisions into force in such other urban areas as may be specified by a notification.\\nLater, the Act was brought into force in the urban areas of Solapur, Aurangabad, Nagpur and Kolhapur.\\nSections 3 and 4 of the Act around which a large part of the argument revolves read thus: \\\"3.\\nProhibition against unauthorised Occupation of vacant land.\\n(1) No person shall, on or after the appointed date, occupy any vacant land or continue in occupation of any vacant land 137 in any urban area or erect any shelter or enclosure or other A structure on such land for the purposes of residence or otherwise without the express permission in writing of the Municipal commissioner in a corporation area, of the Chief officer in a municipal area and elsewhere, of the Collector, or except in accordance with any law for the time being in force in such urban area.\\n(2) No person shall on or after the appointed date abet any person in occupying any vacant land or in continuing to occupy such land in any urban area, or in erecting any shelter, enclosure or other structure on such land for the purposes of residence or otherwise in contravention of the provisions of sub section (1), or shall receive or collect from the occupier of such vacant land any amount whether by way of rent compensation or otherwise or shall in any manner whatsoever operate in relation to the unauthorised occupation of such vacant land.\\nProvided that, the State Government or any officer or authority specified by it in this behalf, shall have a right to receive or collect from the occupier of such vacant land such reasonable amount by way of penal charges as may be determined, by general or special order, by the State Government, till such time as the structure erected in contravention of the provisions of sub section (1) is removed from the land.\\nPayment of any such amount shall not create or confer on the unauthorised occupant any right of occupation of such land or structure.\\nSuch amount if not paid on demand shall be recoverable as an arrear of land revenue.\\nThe amount so collected shall, as far as possible, be utilised for purposes connected with the eviction, rehabilitation and improvement of conditions of unauthorised occupants of vacant lands.\\\" \\\"4.\\nPower of Competent Authority to evict persons from unauthorised occupation of vacant lands.\\n(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in any law for time being in force, if the Competent Authority, either on application or suo motu, has reason to believe that any person is occupying any vacant land in an urban area in contravention of the provisions of section 3, it may by 138 order require such person to vacate the land forthwith or by certain time intimated to such person, and to remove all property therefrom, and if such person fails to comply with the order to vacate the land and to remove all property therefrom, he may be similarly evicted from such land by the Competent Authority, and any property which may be found thereon may be ordered by the Competent Authority to be forfeited to such authority as State Government may by general or special order specify and be removed from the vacant land.\\nFor the purposes of eviction and removal of any such property, the Competent Authority may take, or cause to be taken such steps and use, or cause to be used, such force, and may take such assistance of the Police officers as the circumstance of the case may require.\\nExplanation For the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby declared that the power to take steps under this sub section includes the power to enter upon any land or other property whatsoever.\\n(2) The order of eviction of any person from any vacant land or forfeiture of any property therein or any property therefrom under sub section (1) shall be final and conclusive, and shall not be called in question in any Court.\\n(3) A person who is found to be on any vacant land belonging to, or vesting in, another person shall, unless the contrary is proved by him to the satisfaction of the Competent Authority, be deemed to be in occupation of such vacant land in contravention of the provisions of section 3.\\\" Sections 4 A, 4 B and 4 C were inserted into the Act by the Second Amendment Act.\\nThose sections read thus: \\\"4 A. Permission for renovation of structure on vacant lands a temporary measure in certain circumstances.\\n(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in sections 3 and 4, where any occupier of a structure on a vacant land, in respect of which penal charges are collected from hi under section 3, or any occupier is by an order made under sub section (1) of section 4 required to vacate any vacant 139 land and to remove all property (including any structures) A therefrom, desires to renovate the structure at his risk and expense as a temporary measure, he may seek the previous permission of the Controller of Slums to do so.\\nOn receipt of any application for such permission, if the Controller or Slums is, after such inquiry as he deems fit to make, satisfied that the structure is not fit for human habitation and the proposed renovation is necessary to make it so fit temporarily, he may, subject to such conditions as he may impose grant the required permission.\\n(2) Where any structure is renovated in accordance with the permission granted under sub section (1), the Competent Authority shall not evict the occupier of the structure so renovated.\\ntill such time as the Controller of Slums may specify .\\nProvided that if, in the opinion of the Controller of Slums, occupier has at any time committed a breach of any of the conditions subject to which the permission was granted, he may cancel the permission granted and direct the Competent Authority to take necessary action against the occupier under section 4 forthwith for his eviction and forfeiture and removal of his property.\\n4 B. Recovery of dues of financing institutions, which render assistance for renovation of structures.\\n(1) Where an occupier of any structure referred to in section 4A has availed of an y financial assistance for renovation of the structure from any financing institution recognised by the State Government in this behalf; the Controller of Slums may, at the request of the financing institution, collect on behalf of that institution the amount of loan advanced to the occupier by that institution in such instalments and at such intervals, and remit the amount so collected to the institution in such manner, as may be directed by the State Government.\\n(2) If any such occupier fails to pay any amount due to the financing institution on or before the due date, the Controller of Slums may send to the Collector, a certificate under his hand indicating therein the amount which is due 140 to the financing institution.\\nThereupon, the Collector or any officer authorised by him shall recover the amount due as an arrear of land revenue: Provided that no such certificate shall be sent to the Controller, unless the occupier has been served with a notice by the Controller of slums calling upon him to pay the amount due by a specified date.\\n4 C. Powers of controller of Slums under sections 4A and 4B exercisable by authorised officer also.\\nFor the purposes of section 4A and section 4A, \\\"Con troller of Slums\\\" includes any officer subordinate to him, who is authorised by him in writing in that behalf.\\n\\\" Section 5 of the Act prescribes the penalty for contravention of the provisions of Section 3(1) or for failure to comply with an order made by the Competent Authority under section 4 or for obstructing the Competent Authority in the exercise of any power conferred upon it by the Act.\\nThe penalty extends to imprisonment for a period of three years and fine.\\nSection 8 of the Act provides that no court shall have jurisdiction to entertain any proceeding, civil or criminal, in respect of the eviction of any person from any vacant land under the Act or in respect of any order made or action taken by the Competent Authority in the exercise of the powers conferred by the Act or to grant any stay or injunction in respect of such order or action.\\nThis section further provides if any suit or other proceeding in respect of the eviction of any person from any vacant land is pending on the appointed date in any court, it shall abate.\\nThe expression \\\"Vacant Land\\\" is defined in section 2 (f) of the Act.\\nThe original definition was replaced by the First Amendment Act after which the section reads as follows .\\n\\\"2 (f) 'vacant land ', in relation to any urban area, means (a) all lands in such area, whether agricultural or non.\\nagricultural, which are vacant and are not built upon on the appointed date; 141 (b) all lands in such area on which any structure has been or is being constructed otherwise than in accordance with any law regulating the construction of such structure and which the Competent Authority may, from time to time, by an order in writing, specify and declare to be vacant lands by announcing by beat of drum or other suitable means on or in the vicinity of such lands, and the declaration so made shall be deemed to be notice to all those who are occupying such lands that all such lands shall be vacant lands for the purposes of this Act; and includes, in particular, all lands specified in the Schedule to this Act.\\nThe State Government may, from time to time, by an order, published in the Official Gazette amend that Schedule by adding thereto any land or lands specified in that order or by modifying or transferring any entry in that Schedule.\\n\\\" On December 3, 1971 a Proclamation of Emergency was issued by the President of India under Article 352 of the Constitution on the ground that a grave emergency existed whereby the security of India was threatened by external aggression.\\nAnother proclamation of Emergency was issued under the same Article on June 25, 1975 on the ground that the security of India was threatened by internal disturbance.\\nOn June 27, 1975, the President issued an order under Article 359 (1) suspending the right to move any Court for the enforcement of the fundamental rights conferred by Articles 14, 21, and 22 of the Constitution for the period during which the above two Proclamations of Emergency were in force.\\nOn August 1, 1965, the Constitution (Thirty eighth Amendment) Act, 1977 was passed whereby, clause 1A was inserted in Article 359 with retrospective effect.\\nThe ordinance which preceded the Act in the instant case was passed on November 11, 1975 while the Act was passed on December 24, 1975.\\nAs stated earlier, the Act came into force in the Bombay Metropolitan Region with retrospective effect from November 11, 1975.\\nOn January 8, 1975, the President of India issued another order under Article 359(1) of the Constitution suspending the right of any person to move any Court for the enforcement of any of the fundamental rights conferred by Article 19 of the Constitution for the period during which the said two proclamations of emergency 142 were in force.\\nThe First Amendment Act was passed on August 3, 1976 while the Second Amendment Act was passed on January 25, 1977.\\nThe Proclamation of Internal Emergency was revoked by the President of India on March 21, 1977 while the proclamation of External Emergency was revoked on March 27, 1977.\\nOn April 30, 1979, the Constitution (Forty Fourth Amendment) Act, 1978 was passed.\\nBy section 2 (a) (ii) of the said Act.\\nsub clause (f) of clause (i) of Article 19 was omitted from the Constitution and, by section 2(b), consequential amendments were made in clause (5, of Article 19.\\nBy section 8 of the said Act, Article 31 was omitted from the Constitution.\\nBy section 34, a new chapter, namely, Chapter IV, headed \\\"Right to Property\\\", was inserted in Part XII of the Constitution, containing Article 30O A.\\nAs a result of these constitutional provisions, the Act would be void and would cease to have effect from March 27, 1977 if it infringes the fundamental rights conferred by Articles 14 and 19 of the Constitution.\\nIf it infringed Article 31 (1) of the Constitution on the ground that the provisions of Article 19 (1) (f) were violated, the Act would be void and would cease to have effect from March 27, 1977.\\nIf the State Legislature had no legislative competence to pass the Act or the Act infringed the provisions of clauses 2 or 3 of Article 31, the Act would be void from its inception.\\nPutting it briefly, the Act or any of its provisions would be void or would cease to have effect, as the case may be, from diverse dates depending upon the violation of the particular Article or Articles of the Constitution involved herein.\\nSince the statutory concept of vacant land ' as defined in Section 2 (f) of the Act permeates the entire Act and is, as it were, the quintessence of the Act, respondents concentrated their attention in the High Court on challenging the vires and legality of that definition.\\nThey succeeded in that challenge for the wighty reasons given by the High Court, which we adopt, except with some minor variations.\\nIndeed, if the draftsman were to give to the framing of the Act even a part of the care and concern bestowed upon it by the High Court, though not at the same length, many an impediment in upholding the validity of the Act could have been cleared without much difficulty.\\nIf we were to deal again with the manifold challenges made to the validity of the Act, we will be repeating, more 143 or less, what the High Court has said.\\nTherefore, we propose to dwell upon some of the fundamental objections to which the Act is open and some of the more serious infirmities from which its provisions suffer.\\nComing first to the definition of 'vacant land ', Section 2 (f) as amended retrospectively by the first Amendment Act divides vacant lands into four categories: (1) lands which are in fact vacant, that is to say, not built upon; (2) lands on which structures have been or are being constructed otherwise than in accordance with any law regulating the construction of such structures and which the Competent Authority may specify and declare to be vacant lands by announcing by beat of drum or other suitable means; (3) lands specified in the Schedule to the Act; and (4) lands included in the Schedule by the State Government by an order amending the Schedule.\\nIt is evident, despite some needless controversy upon that question in the High Court, that the expression 'land ' in Section 2 (f) of the Act means plots of land with defined boundaries which are generally recognised for revenue and survey purposes.\\nSection 2(f) (b) requires two conditions to be satisfied in order that a land can be described as a vacant land; Firstly, there has to be an unauthorised structure on the land and secondly, the Competent Authority has, by an order in writing, to specify and declare that land to be a vacant land.\\nThe Act confers upon the Competent Authority the discretion to declare a land as a vacant land without laying down any guidelines to control that discretion.\\nThe Competent Authority has the freedom to pick and choose lands on which there are unauthorised structures and declare some of them as vacant lands and leave other similarly situated untouched.\\nThe second recital in the preamble to the Act on which reliance is placed by the State Government as affording a guideline to the Competent Authority for making a declaration that a certain land is a vacant land cannot serve that purpose.\\nThat recital reads thus: \\\"AND WHEREAS the number of unauthorised occupants on vacant lands in the urban areas in the State was rapidly increasing and was causing grave danger to the public health and sanitation and peaceful life of inhabitants of such areas.\\n\\\" The Act does not contain any provision whatsoever which is 144 directed at ensuring the public health and sanitation or the peaceful life of the inhabitants of the concerned locality.\\nIndeed, nothing is farther removed from the true purpose and object of the Act than these considerations.\\nThe last item in the Schedule to the Act includes all public roads and highways in Greater Bombay.\\nThese, surely, cannot be regarded as constituting a grave danger to public health, sanitation or peaceful life of the citizens.\\nThe circumstances which led to the passing of the Act are mentioned in the Statement of objects and Reasons to the Ordinance which are as follows; \\\"It was found that the vacant lands in Greater Bombay and similar other urban areas were rapidly being unauthorisedly occupied by squatters and traffickers in lands.\\nThe different laws and various authorities constituted under these laws, as well as different procedures laid down by these laws, did not permit immediate demolition of unauthorised huts or prevent the growth of unauthorised structures.\\nThe lengthy procedure laid in the laws also prevented the authorities from taking immediate preventive action.\\nA law which would simplify the procedure and reduce possibilities of litigation, and adequately arm the law enforcing authorities such as Municipal officers, Police officers, Revenue officers and other officers of Government Department to demolish the unauthorised huts and houses was found in mediately necessary.\\nFurther, it was also necessary to take drastic penal action against those who construct unauthorised hutments or colonies of temporary sheds, and traffic in lands and such structures or recover rents by letting out such structures.\\n\\\" It is clear from this Statement that the evil which was sought to be remedied by the ordinance, which was later replaced by the Act, was not danger to public health or sanitation or to the peaceful life of the inhabitants of the Metropolis of Bombay.\\nThe danger posed by the construction of unauthorised structures is the evil which the Act seeks to remedy.\\nThe Act does not also provide for any safeguard against the arbitrary exercise of the discretion conferred upon the Competent Authority to declare a land as a vacant land.\\nIt is true that abuse of 145 power is not to be assumed lightly but, experience belies the expectation that discretionary powers are always exercised fairly and objectively.\\nIn fact, instances of discriminatory declarations made by the Competent Authority were cited in the High Court to which according to the High Court, no satisfactory answer was given in, the return filed on behalf of the State Government.\\nThe Act does not prescribe any procedure which the Competent Authority is required to adopt before declaring a land as a vacant land.\\nThere is no provision in the Act requiring the Competent Authority to observe even the rudimentary norms of natural justice before making the statutory declaration.\\nThe Authority is not obliged to give notice to anyone and it need not hear any person who is likely to be affected by the declaration.\\nThe State Government, too, is under no obligation to follow any set procedure prior to amending the Schedule so as to include new lands therein.\\nThe power conferred by Sections 3(1) and 4(1) of the Act is similarly uncontrolled and arbitrary.\\nIndeed, the hall mark of this ill conceived legislation is; \\\"No notice and no hearing\\\".\\nThere can be cases, though their category ought not be enlarged by Courts, wherein failure to afford to hearing before an adverse decision is rendered may not necessarily vitiate that decision.\\nBut, in cases like those before us, a hearing preceding a decision is of the essence of the matter.\\nIt is notorious as the Statement of objects and Reasons of the ordinance shows, that, in Bombay, open lands have been trespassed upon by professional slumlords who have become a law into themselves.\\nPerhaps, they rise to the occasion by pandering to political needs and pressures but that is beside the point.\\nMassive encroachments on private properties have led to the virtual deprivation of the title of rightful owners of these properties.\\nThe Act penalises such owner for no fault of theirs and, that too, without giving them an opportunity to be heard.\\nThe fact that the power to make the requisite declaration under the Act is vested in officers of the higher echelons makes no difference to this position and is not a palliative to the prejudice which is inherent in the situation.\\nThe judgment of the High Court cites a glaring instance of the arbitrary and undesirable consequences which follow upon orders which are passed unilaterally, that is, without hearing the parties affected by these orders.\\nOne of the petitioners before the High Court was the owner of a hotel called Nakesh Punjab Hotel.\\nHe held various licences which authorised him to run the hotel.\\nThere was a dispute between him and the Revenue Authorities as to the 146 increase in the quantum of assessment, whereupon he obtained an interim injunction from the City Civil Court, Bombay.\\nIn the meanwhile, the Competent Authority issued a Declaration under Section 2(f)(b) of the Act declaring the plot of land on which the hotel stood as a vacant land.\\nWithin a short time thereafter, the hotel was demolished.\\nIt was urged on behalf of the State Government that the infirmity, if any, from which the Act suffered in its inception has been cured by the passing of the Maharashtra Vacant Lands (Prohibition of Unauthorised occupation and Summary Eviction) (Service of Notice) Rules, 1979.\\nBy these Rules, before issuing any order under Section 2(f)(b) or under Section 4(1) of the Act, the Competent Authority is required to serve a written notice upon any person likely to be affected by such order, calling upon him to show cause within such period as may be specified in the notice why the pro posed order should not be issued.\\nThe Competent Authority is further required to consider any objections submitted to it by any such person within the period specified in the notice.\\nRule 3(2) provides for service of such notices.\\nWe are unable to accept that the unconstitutionality of the Act is cured by the framing of the Rules made three and a half years after the Act was passed.\\nBesides, the Rules only provide for a notice to be given and objections to be considered before the passing of an order under sections 2(f)(b) and 4(1).\\nThey do not make a similar provision before permission is granted or refused under section 3(1) of the Act.\\nBut, what is of greater importance is that, even the Rules do not lay down any guidelines for the exercise of the discretion which is conferred upon the Competent Authority by section 2(f)(b) or section 4(1) of the Act.\\nSection 2(f)(b) suffers from yet another vice in that, it treats all persons alike irrespective of how they are situated in the matter of their involvement in the construction of unauthorised structures and their interest therein.\\nClassification requires division into classes which are marked by common characteristics.\\nSuch division has to be founded upon a rational basis and it must be directed at subserving the purposes of the statute.\\nSection 2(f)(b) and the other cognate provisions of the Act make no distinction at all between owners of lands who have themselves constructed unauthorised structures and those others on whose lands unauthorised structures have been constructed by trespassers.\\nThe latter class of owners who are silent spectators to the forcible and lawless deprivation of 147 their title to their property have been put by the Act on par with trespassers who, taking law into their own hand, defy not merely private owners but public authorities.\\nSection 2(f)(b), also, suffers from the infirmity of according equal treatment to unequals.\\nTake a simple example: A plot of land may be vacant in the true sense of the term, that is to say, wholly unbuilt upon.\\nAnother plot of land may have a small structure built upon it in accordance with the Municipal rules and regulations.\\nThe first plot of land attracts drastic provisions of the Act merely by reason of the fact that nothing has been built upon it at all, while the second plot of land is entirely outside the scope of the Act for the reason that some tiny structure is standing thereon.\\na Such a classification betrays lack of rationale.\\nBy the second part of the definition of 'vacant land ' in section 2(f) of the Act, vacant land \\\"includes, in particular, all lands specified in the Schedule to the Act\\\".\\nThe Schedule includes various 'lands ' which are built upon, like the B.E.S.T. Depot (Entry 73), the Health Centre at Nawabwadi (Entry 75), the Pumping Station at Vallabhbhai Patel Nagar (Entry 82), the School in Mulund Village (Entry 130) and, last but not the least, all land occupied by public roads and highways in Greater Bombay (Entry 1555).\\nIt is impossible to understand the scheme of the Schedule or to discover any rational basis behind it.\\nIt is also difficult to understand as to why certain lands which are under acquisition for the purposes of the Maharashtra Housing Board and the Bombay Municipal Corporation have been included in the Schedule and other lands similarly situated have not been so included.\\nSome of the Entries in the Schedule show that unauthorised structures could not have been possibly constructed on the lands mentioned therein.\\nBy and large, the Schedule is divorced from the true object of the Act.\\nThe concluding part of section 2(f) of the Act confers power upon the State Government to amend the Schedule from time to time by an order published in the official Gazette.\\nThis power includes, inter alia, the power to add 'any land or lands ' to the Schedule.\\nNo criterion or standard is laid down in order to enable the State Government to determine objectively as to which lands can be added to the Schedule.\\nThe power to add to the Schedule is in the nature of a legislative power which, in the very nature of things, cannot stipulate for service of notice to the persons affected by the amendment.\\nThis power of amendment of the Schedule is 148 not even conditioned by the fact that the lands added to the Schedule must have unauthorised structures standing thereon.\\nThe State Government is free to pick and choose any land and put it in the Schedule.\\nThis kind of conferment of uncanalised discretion is strawn all over the Act.\\nThus, each part of the definition of 'vacant land ' in section 2(f) of the Act is violative of the provisions of Articles 14 and 19(1)(f) of the Constitution.\\nArticle 19(1)(f) has now lost its relevance after the passing of the Constitution (Forty fourth Amendment) Act, 1978 by which clause (f) was deleted.\\nBut the Act had to satisfy the requirements of that clause so long as it was a part of the Constitution.\\nIt may be relevant at this stage to consider as to what is the ultimate fate of lands which are declared as vacant lands under section 2(f).\\nUntil the Competent Authority passes an order under section 4(1) calling upon an occupier to vacate a land, even a trespasser or an unauthorised occupier can continue to be in possession of the land.\\nIf he is granted permission to occupy the land under section 3(1), he cannot be evicted at all, for the simple reason that the order of eviction under section 4(1) can be passed only if a person is in occupation of a land contrary to the provisions of section 3.\\nEven the eviction of a trespasser from the land can afford no solace to its rightful owner because, the Act does not contain any provision whereby the land can be returned to him after it is freed from unauthorised occupation.\\nIf the owner himself has erected an unauthorised structure, the Act does not provide as to what is to happen to the land after he is evicted therefrom.\\nBy the provisio to section 3(2) which was inserted by the First Amendment Act, power is conferred upon the State Government or, an authority specified in that behalf, to receive and collect from the occupiers of vacant lands a reasonable amount by way of penal charges as may be determined by the State Government Such penal charges can be recovered until such time as the structure erected on the land on contravention of section 3(1) of the Act is removed.\\nThe Statement of objects and Reasons of the First Amendment Act shows that the provision for levying penalty was introduced into the Act in order that occupants of lands on which there were unauthorised structures and.\\nwho are allowed to continue in possession of the structures, do not continue to occupy 149 those lands without payment of any amount at all to public authorities.\\nIt appears that even after forfeiting the structures consequent upon the passing of an order under section 4(1), the State Government has been recovering compensation from unauthorised occupants.\\nIt seems to us quite incongruous that while the true owner is prevented from taking legal proceedings to recover any rent or compensation from persons who had trespassed upon his land, the State Government can recover penal charges from the trespassers.\\nBy the Second Amendment Act, a new section 4 A was inserted in the Act.\\nThat section provides that if any occupier of a structure on a vacant land from whom penal charges are collected under section 3, or if any occupier who is required by an order made under section 4(1) to vacate any vacant land, desires to renovate the structure at his risk as a temporary measure, he may apply to the Controller of Slums for the requisite permission.\\nThe Controller is empowered to grant the permission after making such inquiry as he deems fit, if he is satisfied that the structure is not fit for human habitation and the proposed renovation is necessary to make the structure temporarily fit.\\nOnce such permission is granted and the structure is renovated, the Competent Authority is powerless to evict the occupier of the structure until such time as the Controller of Slums may specify.\\nBy section 4 13, which was also inserted by the Second Amendment Act, financial assistance for renovating structures can be made available by financial institutions recognised by the State Government.\\nIn cases where such financial assistance is availed of, the financial institutions can request the Controller of Slums to collect, on their behalf, the amounts of loans advanced to the occupiers.\\nThe Statement of objects and Reasons of the Second Amendment Act shows that the Government had carried out substantial environment improvements on vacant lands and had sponsored a scheme for building semi permanent houses thereon.\\nThey intended to give to the occupants of such structures security of tenure subject only to the condition of regular repayment by them of the loans given by the financial institutions.\\nThe true owner of lands are totally ignored in this scheme of things, even if they are victims and not the authors of unauthorised constructions.\\nIt was not disputed in the High Court, nor before us, that for a period of more than four years that the Act has been in force, not a single unauthorised and forcible occupier of a vacant land owned by a private person was evicted, nor was a single plot of land encroached upon restored to its rightful owner.\\n150 We are in agreement with the High Court that the Act does not violate the provisions of article 31(1) of the Constitution.\\nIt does not provide for transfer of ownership of vacant lands to the State or to a corporation owned or controlled by the State; nor does it vest in the State the right of the owner or occupier of vacant lands to recover rent or compensation for use and occupation of such lands.\\nWe are, however, unable to accept the view of the High Court that the Act amounts to a measure of requisition and is bad for the reason that it provides for requisition without payment of compensation.\\nIt is straining the language of the Act to hold that it provides, directly or indirectly, for requisition of private property.\\nThe Act does not transfer the right to possession of vacant lands to the State, its agents or its instrumentalities.\\nTherefore, the Act does not offend against the provisions of Article 31(2) of the Constitution.\\nSince that Article is not attracted, no question can arise of the invalidity of the Act on the ground mentioned in Article 31(S), namely, that the Act had not received the assent of the President.\\nIn so far as the question of legislative competence is concerned we uphold the finding of the High Court to the extent that the State Legislature had the competence to pass the Act under Entries 18, 64 and 65 of List II.\\nSince the Act is, in any event, violative of Article 14 of the Constitution, it is unnecessary to consider the question whether, in so far as it violated Article 19 (l) (f), it revived on the deletion of that Article by the Constitution (Forty fourth Amendment) Act.\\nWe express no opinion on the question whether the doctrine of 'eclipse ' applies both the pre Constitution and post Constitution laws or whether that doctrine applies to pre Constitution laws only.\\nFor these reasons, which are substantially similar to the reasons given by the High Court, we affirm the judgment of the High Court and dismiss these appeals with costs.\\nWe quantify the costs in each appeal at rupees two thousand.\\nWe would like to point out before we close that the object of the state legislature in passing the Act was unquestionably laudable.\\nIt is unfortunate that the legislation has traveled far beyond that object.\\nThe State Government has failed in these proceedings not because the legislature lacks the legislative competence to pass the Act mainly because the provisions of the Act are discriminatory.\\n151 The Act was passed during the period of Emergency when some of A the safeguards available under Chapter 111 of the Constitution were suspended on the revocation of the Emergency, the Act ought to have been amended or, better still, a new legislation ought to have been introduced so as to comply with the provisions of the Constitution.\\nWe trust that, in the light of our judgment and the judgment of the High Court, the State Legislature will introduce a carefully conceived legislation on the subject at an early date.\\nThe slumlords, who have trespassed on public and private properties, must be evicted and expeditious steps taken to prevent them exploiting any further the helpless member of the community who are virtually at their mercy.\\nNot only have these defiant law breakers constructed unauthorised structures on private and public properties but, as stated in the objects and Reasons of the Act, they have been collecting extortionate rents from the tenants of such properties, Earlier the State Government acts the better.\\nM.L.A Appeals dismissed. [/INST] The Maharashtra.\\nVacant Lands (Prohibition of Unauthorised occupation and Summary Eviction) Act, LXVI of 1975 passed by the State of Maharashtra was amended twice first by Act No XXXVII of 1976 and later by Act No. VlI of 1977.\\nSection 2 (f) as amended retrospectively by the First Amendment Act divides \\\"Vacant land\\\" into four categories: (1) lands which are in fact vacant, that is to say, not built upon;

(3) lands specified in the Schedule to the Act, and (4) lands included in the Schedule by the State Government by an order amending the Schedule.\\nSection 3 provides that no person shall occupy or enact any shelter enclosure or other structure on such land for the purposes of residence or otherwise without the express permission of the Municipal Corporation and also prohibits any person to collect from the occupier of such vacant land any amount by way 130 of rent or compensation in relation to the unauthorised occupation of such vacant land while it empowers the government to collect or receive from the occupier of such vacant land such reasonable amount by way of penal charges as may be determined till such time as the structure erected in contravention of the provisions of s.3 is removed from the land.\\nSection 4 empowers the government to evict a person occupying any vacant land in an urban area in contravention of the provisions of section 3.\\nSection 4A deals with permission for renovation of structures on vacant lands as a temporary measure in certain circumstances.\\nSection 4B lays down mode of recovery of dues of financial institutions which render assistance for renovation of structures.\\nThe respondents were owners of some plots of land in Bombay.\\nThe plots were assessed to non agricultural assessment and to Property tax by the Bombay Municipal Corporation The respondents had constructed buildings of a Permanent nature on the plots and the same had been provided with essential civic amenities like water and electricity.\\nThe appellants State Government & Municipal Corporation of Bombay called upon the respondents to demolish the buildings since they were constructed without the requisite permission of the Bombay Municipal Corporation.\\nThe respondent 's request to regularize, the unauthorised construction was also rejected because the Government was considering a proposal for acquisition of the said land for the purpose of an industrial estate.\\nThe respondents then approached the Special Land Acquisition officer requesting that the land be released from acquisition.\\nThe Land Acquisition officer informed the respondents that the said plots of land had been released from acquisition by a notification dated September 14, 1964.\\nBut, later on, the said plots of land were declared by the Competent Authority as \\\"vacant land\\\" in exercise of the powers conferred upon it by Section 2 (f) (b) of the Maharashtra Vacant Lands (Prohibition of Unauthorised occupation and Summary Eviction) Act LXVI of 1975.\\nThe respondents challenged before the High Court the constitutional validity of the Act and the legality of orders passed thereunder The High Court declared the Act as violative of the provisions of the Constitution and allowed their writ petitions In the appeals to this Court, the appellants contended that the infirmity, if any, from which the Act suffered in its inception has been cured by the passing of the Maharashtra Vacant Lands (Prohibition of Unauthorised occupation and Summary Eviction) (Service of Notice) Rules, 1979 in as much as the affected person is given a notice before passing an order under section 2 (f) (b) or under section 4(1) of the Act and that the Competent Authority is further required to consider any objections submitted to it by the affected person.\\nOn behalf of the respondents it was argued (1) that at the Act violates the fundamental rights conferred upon them by article 14.\\n19(1)(f) and 51 of the Constitution; (11) that the State Legislature lacked the Legislative competence to pass the Act and (III) that the Act delegated excessive and uncanalised powers to the Executive to pass orders.\\n131 Dismissing the appeals, ^ HELD: 1.1 It is evident that the expression 'land ' in Section 2 (f) of the Act means plots of land with defined boundaries which are generally recognized for revenue and survey purposes.\\nSection 2 (f) (b) requires two conditions to be satisfied in order that a land can be described as a vacant land;

148 A] 3.3.\\nIt is therefore clear that each part of the definition of 'vacant land ' in section 2(f) of the Act is violative of the provisions of Articles 14 and 19 (1) (f) of the Constitution.\\nThe Act had to satisfy the requirements of article 19 (1) (f) so long as it was a part of the Constitution.\\n[148 B C] 133 (4) It may be noted that until the Competent Authority passes an A order under section 4(l) calling upon an occupier to vacate a land, even a trespasser or an unauthorised occupier can continue to be in possession of the eland.\\nlf he is granted permission to occupy the land under section 3(1), he cannot be evicted at all, for the simple reason that the order of eviction under section 4(1) can be passed only if a person is in occupation of a land contrary to the provisions of section 3.\\nEven the eviction of a trespasser from the land can afford no solace to its rightful owner because, the Act doesn 't contain any provision whereby the land can be returned to him after it is freed from unauthorised occupational If the owner himself has erected an unauthorised structure, the Act does not provide as to what is to happen to the land after he is evicted therefrom [148 D F] (5) The Statement of objects and Reasons of the First Amendment Act shows that the provision for levying penalty was introduced into the Act in order that occupants of lands on which there were unauthorised structures and, who are allowed to continue in possession of the structures do not continue to occupy those lands without payment of any amount at all to public authorities.\\nIt appears that even after forfeiting the structures consequent upon the passions of ;U1 order under section 4(l), the State government has been recovering compensation from unauthorised occupants.\\nIt seems quite incongruous that while the true owner is prevented from taking legal proceeding to recover any rent or compensation from persons who had trespassed upon his land, the State Government can recover penal charges from the trespassers.\\nMoreover, the Statement of objects and Reasons of the Second Amendment Act shows that the Government had carried out substantial environmental improvements on vacant lands and had sponsored a scheme for building semi permanent houses thereon.\\nThey intended to give to the occupants of such structures security of tenure subject only to the condition of regular repayment by them of the loans given by the financial institutions.\\nThe true owners of lands are totally ignored in this scheme of things, even if they are victims and not the authors of unauthorised constructions.\\n[14811; 149A B; F G] (6) The unconstitutionality of the Act cannot be cured by the framing of the Rules made three and a half years after the Act was passed.\\nBesides, the Rules only provide for a notice to be given and objections to be considered before the passing of an order under sections 2 (f) (b) and 4(l).\\nThey do not make a similar provision before permission is granted or refused under section 3(1) of the Act.\\nBut, even, the Rules do not lay down any guidelines for the exercise of the discretition which is conferred upon the Competent Authority by section 2(f) (b) or section 4(1) of the Act.\\n[146E F] (7) The Act does not violate the provisions of article 31(1) of the Constitution as it then stood.\\nIt does not provide for transfer of ownership of vacant lands to the State or to a corporation owned or controlled by the State; nor does it vest in the State the right of the owner or occupier of vacant lands to recover rent or compensation for use and occupation of such lands.\\n[150A B] (8) The Act does not amount to a measure of requisition and is not 134 bad for the reason that it provides for requisition without payment of compensation.\\nIt is straining the language of the Act to hold that it provides, directly or indirectly, requisition of private property the Act does not transfer the right to possession of vacant lands to the State, its agents or its instrumentalities.\\nTherefore the Act does not offend against the provisions of Article 31(2) of the Constitution as it then stood Since that Article is not attracted, no question can arise of the invalidity of the Act on the ground mentioned in Article 31(5), namely that the Act had not received the assent of the President.\\n[150C D] (9) In so far as the question of legislative competence is concerned, the High Court was right in holding that the State Legislature had the competence to pass the Act under Entries 18, 64 and 65 of List 11 [150C D] </s>\",\n          \"<s>[INST] Summarize the following judgement: Case No. 22 of 1950.\\nAppeal under article 132(1) of the Constitution against a judgment and order of the Bombay High Court dated 1st Sep tember, 1950, in Criminal Application No. 807 of 1950.\\nThe facts and arguments of counsel are set out in the judgment.\\nM.C.

This is an appeal from a judgment of the High Court at Bombay, ordering the release of the respondent who was detained in custody under a detention order made under the (IV of 1950).\\nThe re spondent was first arrested on the 18th of December, 1948, under the Bombay 171 Public Security Measures Act, 1948 (Bombay Act IV of 1947), but was released on the 11th of November, 1949.\\nHe was arrested again on the 21st of April, 1950, under the Preven tive Detention Act, 1950, and on the 29th of April, 1950`, grounds for his detention 'were supplied to him.\\nThey were in the following terms: \\\"That you are engaged and are likely to be engaged in promoting acts of sabotage on railway and railway property in Greater Bombay.\\n\\\" The respondent filed a habeas corpus petition on the 31st of July, 1950, in which, after reciting his previous arrest and release, in para graphs 6 and 7 he mentioned as follows : \\\"(6) On his release the applicant left Bombay and stayed out of Bombay, that is, in Ratlam and in Delhi.\\n(7) On 20th April, 1950, he returned to Bombay and was immediately arrested as stated above.\\\" He contended that the sole aim of the Government in ordering his detention was not the preservation of public order or the security of the State, but the locking up of active trade unionists who belonged to the All India Trade Union Congress.\\nHe contended that the ground is \\\"delight fully vague and does not mention when, where or what kind of sabotage or how the applicant promoted it.\\\" He further urged that the ground gave no particulars and therefore was not a ground as required to be furnished under the .\\nHe stated that the present appellant acted mala fide, for a collateral purpose, outside the scope of the Act, and that the applicant 's detention in any event was illegal and mala fide.\\nWhen this petition was presented to the Court on the 9th of August, 1950, it directed the issue of a notice to the Commissioner of Police.\\nPending the disposal of the Rule, on the 26th August, 1950, the Commissioner of Police sent a communication to the respond ent as follows: \\\"In pursuance of section 7 of the (Act IV of 1950), and in continuation of my commu nication No. 227 dated the 29th April, 172 1950, the following further particulars are hereby communi cated to you in connection with the grounds on which a detention order has been made against you under sub section (1) of section 3 of the said Act : That the activities mentioned in the grounds furnished to you were being carried on by you in Greater Bombay be tween January 1950 and the date of your detention; and In all probability you will continue to do so.\\nIf, in view Of the particulars now supplied, you wish to make a further representation against the order under which you are detained, you should address it to the Government of Bombay and forward it through the Superintend ent of Arthur Road Prison, Bombay.\\n\\\" On the 30th of August, 1950, the Commissioner of Police filed an affidavit against the petition of the respondent in which it was stated that the objectionable activities were carried on by the applicant between the months of January, 1950, and the date of detention.\\nIt further stated that in or about the month of January, 1950, there was a move for a total strike on the railways in India in the month of March, 1950, and the applicant was taking prominent part to see that the strike was brought ' about and was successful.\\nAs a means to make the strike successful and bring about total cessation of work on all railways, the applicant and his associates were advocating sabotage on railways and railway property in Greater Bombay.\\nHe further stated that reliable materials were put before him of the respondent being en gaged in such activities by experienced police officers.\\nHe added that although the railways strike in the month of March did not materialise, the idea of bringing about such strike as soon as convenient continued to be entertained and the present respondent was actively engaged in bringing about such a strike in the near future.\\nHe then stated that the disclosure of further facts relating to the activities of the detenue was against public interest.\\nIn para.\\n6 there was a specific denial that 173 the respondent, after his release in November, 1949, and till 20th April, 1950, was out of Bombay.\\nIt was stated that he used to go out of Bombay at times but during the major part of the period he was in the city of Bombay.\\nWhen the matter came up before a Bench of the High Court the respondent 's petition was granted.\\nIn the judgment of the Court, Chagla C.J. observed: \\\"It is clear by reason of the view we have taken in several cases under section 491 of the Criminal Procedure Code, that this is not a ground which would enable the detenue to make a representation to which he is entitled both under the Act and under the Constitu tion.\\\" After noticing the affidavit of the Commisioner of Police, it was further observed: \\\"We appreciate the fact that, after our decision was given, Government decided to place all the materials before us so that we should be satisfied that what influenced the detaining authority in making the order was not any ulterior motive but that ample materials were at the disposal of the detaining authority which would justify the applicant 's detention.\\nWe have looked at this affidavit and we have also looked at the particulars furnished to us by Mr. Chudasama.\\nIf these particulars had been furnished at the time when the grounds were furnished on the 29th of April, 1950, very likely we would have come to the conclusion that the grounds were such as would have led the detenue to; know exactly what he was charged with and to make a proper representation.\\n\\\" The judgment is however based on the following observation of the Chief Justice: \\\"Anew and important question arises for our consideration; and that is whether it is permissible to the detaining authority to justify the detention by amplify ing and improving the grounds originally furnished . .\\nThe only grounds which we have to consider and which were furnished in the purported compli ance of article 22(5) were the grounds furnished to the detenue on the 29th of April, 1950; and if these grounds were not such as to enable the detenue to make a proper representation, then there was a 174 violation of the fundamental right and a contravention of the statutory provisions.\\nThat violation and that contra vention cannot be set right by the detaining authority by amplifying or improving the grounds already given.\\nAs we said before, the point of time at which we have to decide whether there was a compliance or not with the provisions of article 22 (5) is the 29th of April, 1950, when the grounds were furnished, and not when further and better particulars were given on the 26th of August 1950.\\n\\\" The learned Attor ney General, appearing for the appellant, has strenuously objected to this line of approach.\\nAs the question of vagueness of grounds for the order of detention and the question whether supplementary grounds could be furnished after the grounds were first given to the detenue have arisen in various High Courts, we think it right that the general principles should be properly appreciated.\\nThe Constitution of India has given legisla tive powers to the States and the Central Government to pass laws permitting preventive detention.\\nIn order that a legis lation permitting preventive detention may not be contended to be an infringement of the Fundamental Rights provided in Part III of the Constitution, article 22 lays down the permissible limits of legislation empowering preventive detention.\\nArticle 22 prescribes the minimum procedure that must be included in any law permitting preventive detention and as and when such requirements are not observed the detention, even if valid an initio, ceases to be \\\"in accord ance with procedure established by law\\\" and infringes the fundamental right of the detenue guaranteed under articles 21 and 22 (s) of the Constitution.\\nIn that way the subject of preventive detention has been brought into the chapter on Fundamental Rights.\\nIn the 3resent case we are concerned only with clauses (5) and (6) of article 22 which run as follows: 22. \\\"(5) When any person is detained in pursuance of an order made under any law providing for preventive detention, the authority making the order shall, 175 as soon as may be, communicate to such person the ground on which the order has been made and shall afford him the earliest opportunity of making a representation against the order.\\n(6) Nothing in clause (5) shall require the authority making any such order as is referred to in that clause to disclose facts which such authority considers to be against the public interest to disclose.\\n\\\" It has to be borne in mind that the legislation in question is not an emergency legislation.\\nThe powers of preventive detention under this Act of 1950 are in addition to those contained in the Criminal Procedure Code, where preventive detention is followed by an inquiry or trial.\\nBy its very nature, preventive detention is aimed at preventing the commission of an offence or preventing the detained person from achieving a certain end.\\nThe authority making the order therefore cannot always be in possession of full detailed information when it passes the order and the infor mation in its possession may fall far short of legal proof of any specific offence, although it may be indicative of a strong probability of the impending commission of a prejudi cial act.\\nSection a of the there fore requires that the Central Government or the State Government must be satisfied with respect to any person that with a view to preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to (1) the defence of India, the relations of India with foreign powers, or the security of India, or (2) the security of the State or the maintenance of public order, or (8) the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community . . it is necessary So to do, make an order directing that such person be detained.\\nAccording to the wording of section 3 therefore before the Government can pass an order of preventive detention it must be satisfied with respect to the individual person that his activities are directed against one or other of the three objects mentioned in the section, and that the detaining authority was satisfied that it was necessary to prevent him from 23 176 acting in such a manner.\\nThe wording of the section thus clearly shows that it is the satisfaction of the Central Government or the State Government on the point which alone is necessary to be established.\\nIt is significant that while the objects intended to be defeated are mentioned, the different methods, acts or omissions by which that can be done are not mentioned, as it is not humanly possible to give such an exhaustive list.\\nThe satisfaction of the Government however must be based on some grounds.\\nThere can be no satisfaction if there are no grounds for the same.\\nThere may be a divergence of opinion as to whether certain grounds are sufficient to bring about the satisfaction required by the section.\\nOne person may think one way, another the other way.\\nIf, therefore, the grounds on which it is stated that the Central Government or the State Gov ernment was satisfied are such as a rational human being can consider connected in some manner with the objects which were to be prevented from being attained, the question of satisfaction except on the ground of mala fides cannot be challenged in a court.\\nWhether in a particular case the grounds are sufficient or not, according to the opinion of any person or body other than the Central Government or the State Government, is ruled out by the wording of the sec tion.\\nIt is not for the court to sit in the place of the Central Government or the State Government and try to deter mine if it would have came to the same conclusion as the Central or the State Government.\\nAs has been generally observed, this is a matter for the subjective decision of the Government and that cannot be substituted by an objec tive test in a court of law.\\nSuch detention orders are passed on information and materials which may not be strict ly admissible as evidence under the Evidence Act in a court, but which the law, taking into consideration the needs and exigencies of administration, has allowed to be considered sufficient for the subjective decision of the Government.\\nAn order having been so permitted to be made, the next step to be considered is, has the detained person 177 any say in the matter? In the chapter on Fundamental Rights, the Constitution of India, having given every citizen a right of freedom of movement, speech, etc. with their relative limitations prescribed in the different articles in Part III, has considered the position of a person detained under an order made under a .\\nThree things are expressly considered.\\nin article 22 (5) it is first considered that the man so detained has a right to be given as soon as may be the grounds on which the order has been made.\\nHe may otherwise remain in custody without having the least idea as to why his liberty has been taken away.\\nThis is considered an elementary right in a free democratic State.\\nHaving received the grounds for the order of deten tion, the next point which is considered is, \\\"but that is not enough; what is the good of the man merely knowing grounds for his detention if he cannot take steps to redress a wrong which he thinks has been committed either in belief in the grounds or in making the order.\\\" The clause therefore further provides that the detained person should have the earliest opportunity making a representation against the order.\\nThe representation has to be against the order of detention because the grounds are only steps for the satis faction of the Government on which satisfaction the order of detention has been made.\\nThe third thing provided is in clause (6).\\nIt appears to have been thought that in convey ing the information to the detained person there may be facts which cannot be disclosed in the public interest.\\nThe authorities are therefore left with a discretion in that connection under clause (6).\\nThe grounds which form the basis of satisfaction when formulated are bound to contain certain facts, but mostly they are themselves deductions of facts from facts.\\nThat is the general structure of article 22, clauses (5) and (6), of the Constitution.\\nThe question arising for discussion is what should be stated in the grounds.\\nIt is argued that whatever may be stated or omitted to be stated, the ground cannot be vague;that the Constitution envisages the 178 furnishing of the grounds once and therefore there is no occasion for furnishing particulars or supplemental grounds at a later stage; and that article 22 (5) does not give the detained person a right to ask for particulars, nor does it give the authorities any right to supplement the grounds, once they have furnished the same.\\nIn our opinion much of the controversy is based on a somewhat loose appreciation of the meaning of the words used in the discussion.\\nWe think that the position will be clarified if it is appreciated in the first instance what are the rights given by article 22 (5). 'The first part of article 22, clause (5), gives a right to the detained person to be furnished with \\\"the grounds on which the order has been made\\\" and that has to be done \\\"as soon as may be.\\\" The second right given to such persons is of being afforded \\\"the earliest opportunity of making a representation against the order.\\n\\\" It is obvious that the grounds for making the order as mentioned above, are the grounds on which the detaining authority was satis fied that it was necessary to make the order.\\nThese grounds therefore must be in existence when the order is made.\\nBy their very nature the grounds are conclusions of facts and not a complete detailed recital of all the facts.\\nThe con clusions drawn from the available facts will show in which of the three categories of prejudicial acts the suspected activity of the particular person is considered to fall, These conclusions are the \\\"grounds\\\" and they must be sup plied.\\nNo part of such \\\"grounds\\\" can be held back nor can any more \\\"grounds\\\" be added thereto.\\nWhat must be supplied are the \\\"grounds on which the order has been made\\\" and nothing less.\\nThe second right of being afforded the \\\"earliest opportunity of making a representation against the order\\\" is not confined to only a physical opportunity by supplying paper and pen only.\\nIn order that a representa tion can be made the person detained must first have knowl edge of the grounds on which the authorities conveyed that they were satisfied about the necessity of making the detention order.\\nIt is therefore clear that if the repre sentation has to be intelligible to meet the charges 179 contained in the grounds, the information conveyed to the detained person must be sufficient to attain that object.\\nOrdinarily, the \\\"grounds\\\" in the sense of conclusions drawn by the authorities will indicate the kind of prejudicial act the detenue is suspected of being engaged in and that will be sufficient to enable him to make a representation setting out his innocent activities to dispel the suspicion against him.\\nOf course if the detenue is told about the details of facts besides the grounds he will certainly be in a better position to deal with the same.\\nIt is significant that the clause does not say that the \\\"grounds\\\" as well as details of facts on which ' they are based must be furnished or fur nished at one time.\\nThe law does not prescribe within what time after the grounds are furnished the representation could be made.\\nThe time in each case appears deliberately unprovided for expressly, because 'circumstances vary in each case and make it impossible to fix a particular time for the exercise of each of these two rights.\\nIt thus appears clear that although both these rights are separate and are to be exercised at different times, they are still connected with each other.\\nWithout getting information sufficient to make a representation against the order of detention it is not possible for the man to make the representation.\\nIndeed the right will be only illusory but not a real right at all.\\nThe right to receive the grounds is independent but it is thus intentionally bound up and connected with the right to make the representation.\\nAlthough these two rights are thus linked up, the contingen cy of further communication between the furnishing of the grounds on which the order is made and the exercise of the right of representation granted by the second part of that clause is not altogether excluded.\\n, One thing is clear from the wording of this clause and that is that after the grounds are once conveyed to the detenue there can be no addition to the grounds.\\nThe grounds being the heads, from which the Government was satisfied that it was necessary to pass the order of detention, there can be no addition to those 180 grounds because such additional grounds will be either the grounds which were not elements to bring about the satisfac tion of the Government or if they were such grounds there has been a breach of the provision of the first part of article 22 (5), as those grounds for the order of detention were not conveyed to the detained person \\\"as soon as may be.\\n\\\" This however does not mean that all facts leading to the conclusion mentioned in the grounds must be conveyed to the detained person at the same time the grounds are conveyed to him.\\nThe facts on which the conclusion mentioned in the grounds are based must be available to the Government, but there may be cases where there is delay or difficulty in collecting the exact data or it may not be convenient to set out all the facts in the first communication.\\nIf the sec ond ' communication contains no further conclusion of fact from facts, but only furnishes all or some of the facts on which the first mentioned conclusion was rounded it is obvious that no fresh ground for which the order of detention was made is being furnished to the detained person by the second communication which follows some time after the first communication.\\nAs regards the contents of that communication therefore he test appears to be whether what is conveyed in the second communication is a statement of facts or vents, which facts or events were already taken into consideration in arriving at the conclusion included in the ground already supplied.\\nIf the later communication contains facts leading to a conclusion which is outside the ground first supplied, the same cannot be looked into as supporting the order of detention and therefore those grounds are \\\"new\\\" grounds.\\nIn our opinion that is the more appropriate expression to be used.\\nThe expression \\\"addi tional grounds\\\" seems likely to lead to confusion of thought.\\nThe next point to be considered is the time factor.\\nif a second communication becomes necessary, when should it be made ? Clause 22 (5) lays down two time factors.\\nThe first is that the grounds should be supplied \\\"as soon as may be \\\" This allows the 181 authorities reasonable time to formulate the grounds on the materials in their possession.\\nThe time element is neces sarily left indeterminate because activities of individuals tending to bring about a certain result may be spread over a long or a short period, or a larger or a smaller area, or may be in connection with a few or numerous individuals.\\nThe time required to formulate the proper grounds of deten tion, on information received, is bound to vary in individu al cases.\\nThere is no doubt that no express words are used to suggest a second communication from the authority to the detained person.\\nBut having regard to the structure of the clause dealing with the two rights connected by the word \\\"and \\\", and the use of the words \\\"as soon as may be\\\" and \\\"earliest opportunity\\\" separately, indicating two distinct time factors, one in respect of the furnishing of grounds and the other in respect of the making of the representa tion, the contingency of a second communication after the grounds are furnished, is not excluded.\\nHowever, the second communication should not be liable to be charged as not being within the measure \\\"as soon as may be \\\".\\nSecondly, it must not create a new ground on which satisfaction of the Government could be suggested to have been arrived at.\\nIn our opinion, if these two conditions are fulfilled, the objection against a later communication of details or facts is not sufficient to cause an infringement of the provision made in article 22(5).\\nThe question has to be approached from another point of view also.\\nAs mentioned above, the object of furnishing grounds for the order of detention is to enable the detenue to make a representation, i.e., to give him an opportunity to put forth his objections against the order of detention.\\nMoreover, \\\"the earliest opportuni ty\\\" has to be given to him to do that.\\nWhile the grounds of detention are thus the main factors on which the subjective decision of the Government is based, other materials on which the conclusions in the grounds are rounded could and should equally be conveyed to the detained person to enable him to make out his objections against the 182 order.\\nTo put ,it in other words, the detaining authority has made its decision and passed its order.\\nThe detained person is then given an opportunity to urge his objections which in cases of preventive detention comes always at a later stage.\\nThe grounds may have been considered suffi cient by the Government to pass its judgment.\\nBut to enable the detained person to make his representation against the order, further details may be furnished to him.\\nIn our opinion, this appears to be the true measure of the proce dural rights of the detained person under article 22 (5).\\nIt was argued that under article 22 (6) the authorities are permitted to withhold facts which they consider not desirable to be disclosed in the public interest.\\nIt was argued that therefore all other facts must be disclosed.\\nIn our opinion that is not the necessary conclusion from the wording of article 22 (6).\\nIt gives a right to the detaining authority not to disclose such facts, but from that it does not follow that what is not stated or considered to be withheld on that ground must be disclosed and if not dis closed, there is a breach of a fundamental right.\\nA wide latitude is left to the authorities in the matter of disclo sure.\\nThey are given a special privilege in respect of facts which are considered not desirable to be disclosed in public interest.\\nAs regards the rest, their duty is to disclose facts so as to give the detained person the earliest oppor tunity to make a representation against the order of deten tion.\\nOn behalf of the respondent, it was argued that if the grounds of detention are vague or insufficiently clear there will result a failure to give him the earliest opportunity to make a representation against the order of detention and that defect in its turn must affect the satisfaction on which the order of detention was made.\\nIt was argued that just as a ground which is completely irrelevant, and there fore, in law is no ground at all, could not satisfy any rational person about the necessity for the order, a vague ground 183 which is insufficient to enable the detenue to make a repre sentation would similarly make the order of detention based on it, void.\\nIn our opinion, this argument is un sound.\\nAlthough the ground may be good there may be a certain indefiniteness in its statement.\\nProceeding on the footing that there is some connection, i.e., the ground by itself is not so convincingly irrelevant and incapable of bringing about satisfaction in any rational person, the question whether such ground can give rise to the satisfac tion required for making the order is outside the scope of the inquiry of the court.\\nOn the other hand, the question whether the vagueness or indefinite nature of the statements furnished to the detained person is such as to give him the earliest opportunity to make a representation to the author ity is a matter within the jurisdiction of the court 's inquiry and subject to the court 's decision.\\nThe analogy sought to be drawn between a ground which can have no connection whatsoever with the order and a ground which on its face has connection with the order but is not definite in its statement, is clearly faulty.\\nThe extreme position, on the other hand, that there is no connection between the ground to be furnished and the representation to be made by the detained person under article 22 (5) is equally unsound, when the object in furnishing the ground is kept in mind.\\nThe conferment of the right to make a representation necessarily carries with it the obligation on the part of the detaining authority to furnish the grounds, i.e., materials on which the detention order was made.\\nIn our opinion, it is therefore clear that while there is a connec tion between the obligation on the part of the detaining authority to furnish grounds and the right given to the detained person to have an earliest opportunity to make the representation, the test to be applied in respect of the contents of the grounds for the two purposes is quite dif ferent.\\nAs already pointed out, for the first, the test is whether it is sufficient to satisfy the authority.\\nFor the second, the test is, 24 184 whether it is sufficient to enable the detained person to make the representation at the earliest opportunity.\\nThe argument advanced on behalf of the respondent mixes up the two rights given under article 22 (5) and converts it into one indivisible right.\\nWe are unable to read article 22 (5) in that way.\\nAs pointed out above, the two rights are connected by the word \\\"and\\\".\\nFurthermore, the use of the words \\\"as soon as may be\\\" with the obligation to furnish the grounds of the order of detention, and the fixing of another time limit, viz. the earliest opportunity, for making the representation, makes the two rights distinct.\\nThe second right, as it is a right of objection, has to depend first on the service of the grounds on which the conclusion, i.e., satisfaction of the Government about the necessity of making the order, is based.\\nTo that extent, and that extent alone, the two are connected.\\nBut when grounds which have a ration al connection with the ends mentioned in section a of the Act are supplied, the first condition is satisfied.\\nIf the grounds are not sufficient to enable the detenue to make a representation, the detenue can rely on his second right and if he likes may ask for particulars which will enable him to make the representation.\\nOn an infringement of either of these two rights the detained person has a right to approach the court and complain that there has been an infringement of his fundamental right and even if the infringement of the second part of the right under article 22 (5) is established he is bound to be released by the court.\\nTo treat the two rights mentioned in article 22 (s) as one is neither proper according to the language used, nor according to the purpose for which the rights are given.\\nThe contention that the grounds are vague requires some clarification.\\nWhat is meant by vague ? Vague can be considered as the antonym of 'definite '.\\nIf the ground which is supplied is incapable of being understood or de fined with sufficient certainty it can be called vague.\\nIt is not possible to state affirmatively more on the question of what is vague.\\nIt must vary according to the circum stances of each case.\\nIt is 185 however improper to contend that a ground is necessarily vague if the only answer of the detained person can be to deny it.\\nThat is a matter of detail which has to be examined in the light of the circumstances of each case.\\nIf on reading the ground furnished it is capable of being intel ligently understood and is sufficiently definite to furnish materials to enable the detained person to make a represen tation against the order of detention it cannot be called vague.\\nThe only argument which could be urged is that the language used in specifying the ground is so general that it does not permit the detained person to legitimately meet the charge against him because the only answer which he can make is to say that he did not act as generally suggested.\\nIn certain cases that argument may support the contention that having regard to the general language used in the ground he has not been given the earliest opportunity to make a repre sentation against the order of detention.\\nIt cannot be disputed that the representation mentioned in the second part of article 22 (5) must be one which on being considered may give relief to the detained person.\\nThe argument that supplementary grounds cannot be given after the grounds are first given to the detenue, similarly requires a closer examination.\\nThe adjective \\\"supplemen tary\\\" is capable of covering cases of adding new grounds to the original grounds, as also giving particulars of the facts which are already mentioned, or of giving facts in addition to the facts mentioned in the ground to lead to the conclusion of fact contained in the ground originally fur nished.\\nIt is clear that if by \\\"supplementary grounds\\\" is meant additional grounds, i.e., conclusions of fact required to bring about the satisfaction of the Government, the furnishing of any such additional grounds at a later stage will amount to an infringement of the first mentioned right in article 22 (5) as the grounds for the order of detention must be before the Government before it is satisfied about the necessity for making the order and all such grounds have to be furnished 186 as soon as may be.\\nThe other aspects, viz., the second communication (described as supplemental grounds) being only particulars of the facts mentioned or indicated in the grounds first supplied, or being additional incidents which taken along with the facts mentioned or indicated in the ground already conveyed lead to the same conclusion of fact, (which is the ground furnished in the first instance) stand on a different footing.\\nThese are not new grounds within the meaning of the first part of article 22 (5).\\nThus, while the first mentioned type of \\\"additional\\\" grounds cannot be given after the grounds are furnished in the first instance, the other types even if furnished after the grounds are furnished as soon as may be, but provided they are furnished so as not to come in conflict with giving the earliest opportunity to the detained person to make a repre sentation, will not be considered an infringement of either of the rights mentioned in article 22 (5) of the Constitu tion.\\nThis detailed examination shows that preventive deten tion is not by itself considered an infringement of any of the fundamental rights mentioned in Part III of the Consti tution.\\nThis is, of course, subject to the limitations prescribed in clause (5) of article 22.\\nThat clause, as noticed above, requires two things to be done for the person against whom the order is made.\\nBy reason of the fact that clause (5)forms part of Part III of the Constitution, its provisions have the same force and sanctity as any other provision relating to fundamental rights.\\nAs the clause prescribes two requirements, the time factor in each case is necessarily left fluid.\\nWhile there is the duty on the part of the detaining authority to furnish grounds and the duty to give the detained person the earliest opportunity to make a representation, which obligations, as shown above, are correlated, there exists no express provision contemplating a second communication from the detaining authority to the person detained.\\nThis is because in several cases a second communication may not be necessary at all.\\nThe only thing which emerges from the discussion is that while the authori ties must 187 discharge the duty in furnishing grounds for the order detention \\\"as soon as may be\\\" and also provide \\\"the earliest opportunity to the detained person to ' make the representa tion\\\", the number of communications from the detaining authority to the detenue may be one or more and they may be made at intervals, provided the two parts of the aforesaid duty are discharged in accordance with the wording of clause (5).\\nSo long as the later communications do not make out a new ground, their contents are no infringement of the two procedural rights of the detenue mentioned in the clause.\\nThey may consist of a narration of facts or particulars relating to the grounds already supplied.\\nBut in doing so the time factor in respect of the second duty, viz. to give the detained person the earliest opportunity to make a representation, cannot be overlooked.\\nThat appears to us to be the result of clause (5) of article 22.\\nIn numerous cases that have been brought to our notice, we have found that there has been quite an unnecessary obscurity on the part of the detaining authority in stating the grounds for the order.\\nInstead of giving the information with reasonable details, there is a deliberate attempt to use the minimum number of words in the communication convey ing the grounds of detention.\\nIn our opinion, this attitude is quite deplorable.\\nWe agree with the High Court of Bombay in its observation when it says: \\\"In all the matters which have come up before us we have been distressed to find how vague and unsatisfactory the grounds are which the detaining authority furnished to the detenue; and we are compelled to say that in almost every case we have felt that the grounds could have been ampler and fuller without any detriment to public interest.\\n\\\" While the Constitution gives the Govern ment the privilege of not disclosing in public interest facts which it considers undesirable to disclose, by the words used in article 22 (5) there is a clear obligation to convey to the detained person materials (and the disclosure of which is not necessary to be withheld) which will enable him to make a representation.\\nIt may be 188 noticed that the may not even contain machinery to have the representation looked into by an independent authority or an advisory board.\\nUnder these circumstances, it is but right to emphasize that the commu nication made to the detained person to enable him to make the representation should, consistently with the privilege not to disclose facts which are not desirable to be dis closed in public interest, be as full and adequate as the circumstances permit and should be made as soon as it can be done.\\nAny deviation from this rule is a deviation from the intention underlying article 22 (5) of the Constitution.\\nThe result of this attitude of some detaining authorities has been that, applying the tests mentioned ' above, several communications to the detained persons have been found wanting and the orders of detention are pronounced to be invalid.\\nHaving regard to the principles mentioned above, we have to consider whether the judgment of the High Court is cor rect.\\nWe have already pointed out that the summary rejec tion by the High Court of the later communication solely on the ground that all materials in all circumstances must be furnished to the detenue when the grounds are first communi cated, is not sound.\\nWe have indicated the circumstances and conditions under which the later communication may or may not be considered as falling within the purview of article 22 (5) of the Constitution.\\nIn dealing with the position when the grounds were first communicated, the High Court held as follows: \\\"This is not a ground which would enable the detenue to make a representa tion to which he is entitled both under the Act and under the Constitution.\\n\\\" In this case the later communication of the 26th August, 1950, was made after the respondent filed his petition and it appears to have been made to controvert his allegation that he was never in Bombay between January and April, 1950, as alleged in his affidavit.\\nAfter taking into consideration this communication it was observed by Chagla C.J. that if these particulars had been furnished on 29th April, 1950, very likely the 189 court would have rejected the petition.\\nThe court set the respondent free only because of its view that after 29th April no further communication was permissible. ' In our opinion, this view is erroneous.\\nWe think that on the facts of the present case therefore the respondent 's petition should have been dismissed.\\nWe therefore allow the appeal.\\nPATANJALI SASTRI.\\nWhile I concur in the order pro posed by my Lord that this appeal should be allowed, I regret I find myself unable to agree with him on the true meaning and effect of article 22, clause (8), which is reproduced in section 7 of the , (hereinafter referred to as \\\"the Act\\\").\\nPut shortly, the question that falls to be decided is: Is it within the competence of the court to examine the grounds communicated to a person detained under the Act, with a view to see if they are sufficient in its opinion to enable him to make a representation to the detaining authority against the order, and if they are not, to direct his release ? It is now settled by the decision of the majority in Gopalan 's case(1) that article 21 is applicable to preven tive detention except in so far as the provisions of article 22 (4) to (7) either expressly or by necessary implication exclude its application, with the result that a person cannot be deprived of his personal liberty, even for preven tive purposes, \\\"except according to procedure established by law.\\\" Part of such procedure is provided by the Constitution itself in clauses (5) and (6) of article 22 which read as follows: \\\"(5) When any person is detained in pursuance of an order made under any law providing for preventive detention, the authority making the order shall, as soon as may be, communicate to such person the grounds on which the order has been made and shall afford him the earliest opportunity of making a representation against the order.\\n(6) Nothing in clause (5) shall require the authority making any such order as is referred to in that clause (1) ; 190 to disclose facts which such authority considers to be against the public interest to disclose.\\nIf this procedure is not complied with, detention under the Act may well be held to be unlawful, as it would then be deprivation of personal liberty which is not in accordance with the procedure established by law.\\nThe question accord ingly arises as to what are the requirements of article 22 (5) and whether they have been complied with in the present case ? On behalf of the respondent it is urged that the clause provides two safeguards for the person ordered to be de tained, namely, that (1) the grounds of his detention should be communicated to him as soon as may be, and (2) he should be given the earliest opportunity of making a representation against the order.\\nAs there is to be no trial in such cases, the right of making a representation affords, it is said, the only opportunity to the person detained to repell the accusation brought against him and establish his innocence.\\nIt is the communication of the grounds of detention that is expected to give him notice of what he is to meet by making a representation.\\nThe grounds must, therefore, it is sub mitted, give sufficient indication of the nature and extent of the information on which action has been taken against him and must contain sufficient particulars of the time and place of the acts charged, so as to enable him to make his representation effective as far as it is in his power to do so.\\nIf the grounds are vague and do not disclose the sub stance of the information on which the detention has been based, there would be no real compliance with the procedure prescribed by article 22 (s), and the detention must, it is claimed, be unlawful.\\nIn other words, the sufficiency of the grounds for the purpose of enabling the person detained to make an effective representation against the order of deten tion is, in every case, a justiciable issue.\\nIt must now be taken as settled by the decision of this Court in Gopalan 's case(1), which on this point was (1) 191 unanimous, that section 3 of the Act is constitutional and valid notwithstanding that it leaves it to the, \\\"satisfac tion\\\" of the executive government to decide whether action under the Act is to be taken or not against any particular person or persons.\\nThe learned:Chief Justice pointed out (at p. 121) that action by way of preventive detention must be based largely on suspicion, and quoted the remark of Lord Finlay in Rex vs Halliday(1), that a court is the least appropriate tribunal to investigate the question whether circumstances of suspicion exist warranting the re straint on a person.\\nDealing with a similarly worded provision of the Central Provinces and Berar Public Safety Act, 1948, the Federal Court declared in another unanimous judgment, that \\\"The language clearly shows that the respon sibility for making a detention order rests upon the provin cial executive as they alone are entrusted with the duty of maintaining public peace;and it would be a serious deroga tion from that responsibility if the court were to substi tute its judgment for the satisfaction of the executive authority and, to that end, undertake an investigation of the sufficiency of the materials on which such satisfaction was grounded . .\\nThe court can, however, examine the grounds disclosed by the Government to see if they are relevant to the object which the legislation has in view, namely, the prevention of acts prejudicial to public safety and tranquillity, for \\\"satisfaction\\\" in this connection must be grounded on material which is of rationally probative value\\\" Machindar Shivaji Mahar vs The King (2).\\nThese decisions clearly establish, what indeed is plain from the nature of the measure, that preventive detention is a form of precautionary police action, to be employed on the sole responsibility of the executive government whose discretion is final, no recourse being permitted to a court of law by way of review or justification of such action except on allegations of mala fides or irrational conduct.\\n(1) ; , 269.\\n(2) [1949 50] 25 192 When the power to issue a detention order has thus been made to depend upon the existence of a state of mind in the detaining authority, that is, its \\\"satisfaction\\\", which is a purely subjective condition, so as to exclude a judicial enquiry into the sufficiency of the grounds to justify the detention, it seems to me to be wholly inconsistent with that scheme to hold that it is open to the court to examine the sufficiency of the same grounds to enable the person detained to make a representation, for, be it noted, the grounds to be communicated to the person detained are the \\\"grounds on which the order has been made.\\\" Indeed, the logical result of the argument advanced by the respondent 's counsel would be to invalidate section 3 of the Act in so far as it purports to make the satisfaction of the govern ment the sole condition of a lawful detention, for, if clause (5) of article 22 were to be construed as impliedly authorising a judicial review of the grounds of detention to see if they contain sufficient particulars for making a representation, then, the subjective condition prescribed in section 3 would be inconsistent with that clause and there fore void.\\nWhen this was pointed out to counsel he submit ted that the decision in Gopalan 's case (1) as to the con stitutionality of section 3 required reconsideration in the light of his arguments based on article 22, clause (5).\\nAlthough the clause was not then considered from this point of view, it came in for a good deal of discussion in connec tion with section 14 of the Act and the present argument must, in my opinion, be rejected because it runs counter to that decision.\\nApart from this aspect of the matter, I am not much impressed with the merits of the argument.\\nWhile granting, in view of the structure and wording of clause (5), that the grounds communicated to the person detained are to form the basis of his representation against the order, I am unable to agree with what appears to be the major premise of the argument, namely, that clause (5) contemplates an inquiry where the person detained is to be formally charged with (1) [1950] S.C.R.188, 193 specific acts or omissions of a culpable nature and called upon to answer them.\\nAs pointed out by Lord Atkinson in Rex vs Halliday (1), preventive detention ' being a precautionary measure, \\\"it must necessarily proceed in all cases to some extent on suspicion or, anticipation as distinct from proof\\\", and it must be capable of being employed by the executive government in sudden emergencies on unverified information supplied to them by their police or intelligence officers.\\nthe Government, acting honestly and in good faith make an order being \\\"satisfied\\\" on such information, however lacking in particulars, that a person should be detained in the public interest, as they have been empowered by Parliament to do, then all that article 22 (5) requires of them is to communicate as soon as may be the grounds which led to the making of the order, to the person concerned, and to give him the earliest opportunity of making any represen tation which he may wish to make on the basis of what is communicated to him.\\nIf such communication is made and such opportunity is given the detaining authority will have complied with the procedure prescribed by the Constitution, and the person under detention cannot complain that he has been deprived of his personal liberty otherwise than in accordance with the procedure established by law.\\nI can find nothing in article 22, clause (5), to warrant the view that the grounds on which the order of detention has been made must be such that, when communicated to the person detained they are found by a court of law to be sufficient to enable him to make what the court considers to be an adequate representation.\\nThe right to be produced before a Magistrate and to consult and be defended by a legal practi tioner is expressly denied by the Constitution itself to a person under preventive detention [vide article 22 (1), (2) and (3)3 and this.\\nCourt held in Gopalan 's case(2) that there was nothing in the Constitution to entitle him to a hearing even before the detaining authority.\\nAll this underlines the executive character of the function exercised by (1) ; , 275.\\n(2) ; , 194 the authority which does not in any way embark on a judicial or quasi judicial inquiry.\\nIn such circumstances the repre sentation which the person detained is allowed to make to the Government, which is constituted the judge in its own cause, cannot be assumed to be similar in scope or purpose to a defence against a formulated charge in a court of law.\\nThe argument, therefore, that the right of making a repre sentation should be made effective in the sense that such person should be enabled to defend himself successfully if possible, and, for that purpose, the detaining authority should communicate to him the necessary particulars on pain of having the order quashed if such particulars are not furnished, proceeds on a misconception of the true position.\\nPerhaps the most cogent reason for rejecting the argu ment is to be found in the language and provision of clause (6) of article 22.\\n\\\"Nothing in clause (5)\\\", that is to say, neither the right to be informed of the \\\"grounds\\\" of deten tion nor the right to make a \\\"representation\\\" shall \\\"require\\\" the detaining authority to disclose facts which the authority \\\"considers\\\" should not be disclosed in the public interest.\\nIn other words, clause (5) should not be taken to import an obligation to provide particulars which the authority is given an absolute discretion to furnish or withhold.\\nI cannot understand how it can be claimed, in the face of clause (6), that it is incumbent on the executive govern ment to communicate particulars which a court of law consid ers necessary to enable the person detained to make a repre sentation.\\nIt cannot be compulsory to furnish what the authority is given an uncontrolled power to decide to give or to refuse.\\nThe combined effect of clauses (5) and (6) is, to my mind, to require the detaining authority, to communicate to the person affected only such particulars as that authority and not a court of law, considers sufficient to enable the said person to make a representation.\\nIt is worthy of note that in the well known English case of Liversidge vs Anderson C), the existence of a (1) ; 195 similar privilege was regarded as a \\\"very cogent reason\\\" for holding that the words \\\"If the Secretary of State has rea sonable cause to believe\\\" did not raise a justiciable issue as to the existence of such cause as an objective fact.\\nViscount Maugham observed \\\"It is beyond dispute that he can decline to disclose the information on which he has acted on the ground that to do so would be contrary to the public interest, and that this privilege of the Crown cannot be disputed.\\nIt is not ad rem on the question of construction to say in reply to this argument that there are cases in which the Secretary of State could answer the attack on the validity of the order for detention without raising the point of privilege.\\nIt is sufficient to say that there must be a large number of cases in which the information on which the Secretary of State is likely to act will be of a very confidential nature.\\nThat must have been plain to those responsible in advising His Majesty in regard to the Order in Council, and it constitutes, in my opinion, a very cogent reason for thinking that the words under discussion cannot be read as meaning that the existence of 'reasonable cause ' is one which may be discussed in a court which has not the power of eliciting the facts which in the opinion of the Secretary of State amount to 'reasonable cause '.\\n\\\" There was considerable discussion as to the meaning of the words \\\"grounds\\\" and \\\"representation\\\" used in clause (5).\\nThese are words of very wide connotation and, in the view I have expressed, it is unnecessary to define them.\\nIt may, however, be noted that clauses (5) and (6) are not mutually exclusive in the sense that, when clause (6) is invoked, clause (5) ceases to be applicable.\\nWhen, therefore, the detaining authority withholds the material facts under clause (6)and communicates to the person detained the grounds of detention, which in that case must be necessari ly vague, it would still be communicating to him the \\\"grounds\\\" on which the order has been made, and such repre sentation as the person may wish to make on the basis of that communication would 196 still be a \\\"representation \\\", within the meaning of clause (5).\\nThis shows that no precise connotation can be at tributed to the terms \\\"grounds\\\" and\\\" re presentation\\\" as used in clause (5), for in certain cases at least, the one can be vague and the other inade quate from the point of view of the person detained and, on a question of construction they need not be different in other cases.\\nIt was suggested in the course of the argument that clause (5) dealt with two distinct and independent matters, namely, (1) the communication of the grounds of detention, and (2) the affording of an opportunity to make a represen tation against the detention, and that the grounds communi cated need not have any necessary relation to the represen tation provided for.\\nthe right to make a representation, it was said, imported, by implication, an independent obliga tion on the part of the authority to furnish the person detained with sufficient particulars and details of the accusation against him apart from and in addition to the obligation expressly imposed on the authority to communicate the grounds on which the order has been made, for the reason that without such particulars no adequate or effective representation could be made ' against the order, and though the sufficiency of the Grounds on which the order was based had been held not to be open to judicial examination, there was no reason why the sufficiency of the further communica tion implied in the provision for representation should not be justiciable.\\nThe different time limits fixed for he performance of the duties imposed by clause (5) on the detaining authority are said to support this argument.\\nThe construction suggested is, in my opinion, strained and artificial and cannot be accepted.\\nThe collocation in the same clause of the right to be informed of the grounds of detention and the right to make a representation against it indicate, to my mind, that the grounds communicated are to form the basis of the representation and, indeed, are in tended mainly, if not solely, for that purpose.\\nTo suggest that, apart from those grounds, and right of making a repre sentation 197 imports, by necessary implication, a further obligation to give such details and particulars as would render that right effective is, in my opinion, not to ' construe the clause in its natural meaning but to stretch it by the process of implication, so as to square, with one 's preconceived no tions of justice and fairplay.\\nNo support for this construc tion can be derived from the provision of distinct time limits for the communication of the grounds and the afford ing of opportunity for representation.\\nas that can be ex plained by the different degrees of urgency required in the two cases.\\nThe grounds are to be communicated \\\"as soon as may be\\\" which means as soon as possible and imports a much higher degree of urgency than what is implied in affording the \\\"earliest opportunity\\\" which, I take it, means affording writing and communication facilities to the person under detention as soon as he is ready and desires to make the representation.\\nWhile clause (5) does not allow the authority, after making the order of detention and communicating the grounds of such order, to put forward fresh grounds in justification of that order, I can find nothing in that clause to preclude the authority furnishing particulars or details relating to the grounds originally communicated, or the person under detention availing himself of such particulars and making a better or a further representation.\\nNor is there anything to prevent such person from asking for, or the authority from providing, further and better particulars of those grounds where it is in a position to do so.\\nBut the attempt in these and similar proceedings has always been not to secure the necessary particulars but to shift the arena of the contest to the court which, as Lord Finlay remarked in the case already referred to, is the least appropriate tribunal for investigating what must largely be matters of suspicion and not proof and which, for that very reason, might afford the relief hoped for without being in posses sion of all the facts.\\nReference was made to the decisions of several High Courts dealing with the necessity of furnishing particulars of the grounds of detention.\\nBut those decisions 198 turned on the provisions of the various Provincial Public Safety Acts which were passed before the commencement of the Constitution and which, in most cases, specifically provided for the communication of particulars.\\nThose decisions are of no assistance to the respondent as neither in article 22 nor in the Act is there any express provision that particulars of the grounds of detention should be given to the person detained.\\nOur attention was called to the decision of this court in Ishwar Das vs The State(1) as an instance where this court considered the grounds of detention to be vague and directed the release of the petitioner in that case from detention under the Act.\\nAs pointed out in the brief judg ment in that case, no arguments were addressed on the point and the case was disposed of on the view prima.\\nfacie sup ported by the decisions already referred to that, if the grounds were too general and vague to enable the person under detention to make a representation, he was entitled to be released.\\nNo value can therefore be attached to that decision as a precedent.\\nIn the course of the debate it was repeatedly urged that this court should be jealous in upholding the liberty of the subject which the Constitution has guaranteed as a fundamental right and must not adopt a construction of article 22 (5) which would rob the safeguards provided therein of all their efficacy.\\nI am profoundly conscious of the sanctity which the Constitution attaches to personal liberty and other fundamental rights and of the duty of this court to guard against inroads on them by the legislature or the executive.\\nBut when, as has been stated, the Constitu tion itself has authorised preventive detention and denied to the subject the right of trial before a court of law and of consulting or being defended by a legal practitioner of his choice, providing only certain procedural safeguards, the court could do no more than construe the words used in that behalf in their natural sense consistently with the nature, purpose and scheme of the measure thus authorised, to ascertain what (1) Not reported.\\n199 powers are still left to the court in the matter.\\nIt is in this light that I have endeavoured to construe clause (5) and, for the reasons indicated above, I have come to the conclusion that it is not the province of the court to examine the sufficiency of the grounds for the purpose of making a representation, a matter left entirely to the discretion of the executive authority.\\nAn argument in sup port of the liberty of the subject has always a powerful appeal but the court should, in my opinion, resist the temptation of extending its jurisdiction beyond its legiti mate bounds.\\nDAS J.\\nThis appeal from a decision of the Bombay High Court raises a very important question as to the sufficiency of the grounds of an order of detention under the Preven tive Detention Act, 1950.\\nThe question depends, for its answer, on a correct interpretation of clauses (5) and (6) of article 22 of our Constitution which have been reproduced in section 7 of the Act.\\nA similar question has also been raised in another appeal filed in this court by one hundred detenus from the decision of a Bench of the Calcutta High Court, being Case No. 24 of 1950 (Tarapada and Others vs The State of West Bengal)(1).\\nAs the view I. have taken as to the true meaning and effect of the relevant provisions of the Constitution and of the Act has not commended itself to the majority of my colleagues, I express it with a certain amount of diffidence arising out of the high regard I have for their opinions.\\nUnder section 3 (1) (a) of the Act the authority con cerned can make an order of detention only if he is satis fied that, with a view to preventing a person from acting in a manner prejudicial to one or more of the matters referred to in sub clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of clause (a), an order should be made.\\nWhat materials will engender in the mind of the authority the requisite satisfaction under section 3 (1) of the Act will depend on the training and temperament and the habitual mental approach of the person who is the authority to (11) Reported infra at p. 212 (1) Reported infra at p.212.\\n26 200 make the detention order.\\nThe authority concerned may be a person who will not derive the requisite satisfaction except on very precise and full information amounting almost to legal proof or he may be a person equally honest who will be so satisfied on meagre information which may appear to others to be very vague or even nebulous.\\nIf the authority is a person of the first mentioned type, then the \\\"grounds\\\" on which he will make the order will necessarily be more precise and fuller in particulars than the \\\"grounds\\\" on which an order may be made by the authority who is a person of the second mentioned type.\\nThe \\\"grounds\\\" on which the authority who is a person of the first mentioned type makes an order of detention create no difficulty, for such grounds are quite precise and ample, and, when communicated to the detenu, will clearly enable him to appreciate the reasons for his detention and to make his representation.\\nWe are, however, concerned with the \\\"grounds\\\" on which an order of detention may be made by the authority who is a person of the second mentioned type who may derive the requisite satisfaction from the conclusions which he may draw from the available information, which may not be precise or ample but on which, having regard to his source of information, the authority may honestly feel safe to rely and to act.\\nThis last mentioned type of grounds\\\" will, in the following discussion, be referred to as \\\"vague grounds\\\".\\nThe question for our decision is whether an order of detention made in good faith on such \\\"vague grounds\\\" is valid when it is made and whether if valid when made, becomes invalid because these very grounds, when communicated to the detenu, are found to be insufficient to enable him to make a representa tion.\\nThe first question urged by the learned counsel for the detenu is that an order of detention made upon grounds which are too vague to enable the detenu to to make a representa tion against the order is bad ab initio.\\nThe argument is thus formulated.\\nArticle 22 (5) requires two things, name ly, first, that the authority 201 making the order of detention shall, as soon as may be, communicate to the detenu the grounds on which the, order has been made and, secondly, that the authority ' shall afford him the earliest opportunity to make a representation against the order.\\nThe two requirements 'are correlated.\\nThe object of the communication of the grounds, according to the argument, is to enable the detenu to make a representation against the order of detention and the combined effect of the two constitutional requirements is that the grounds on which the order is made must be such as will, when communi cated to the detenu, enable him to make a representation.\\nIf the grounds communicated are too vague being devoid of particulars, then no representation can be made on the basis of them and if no representation can be made on the basis of these grounds, no order of detention could properly have been made on those grounds, for it is the grounds on which the order had been made that have to be communicated to the detenu so as to enable him to make a representation.\\nThe argument, shortly put, is that the implied requirement that the grounds must be such as will enable the detenu to make a representation also indicates the quality or attribute of the grounds on which the order of detention may be made.\\nWhether the grounds satisfy the requirements of article 22 (5) is not left to the subjective opinion of the authority which makes the order of detention but an objective test is indicated, namely, that the grounds must be such as will enable the detenu to make a representation which quite clearly makes the matter justiciable.\\nIf the court finds that no representation may be made on account of the vague ness of the grounds.\\nthe court must also hold that the order made on such vague grounds cannot be sustained.\\nThe next step in the argument is that the provisions of the Preven tive Detention Act, 1950 (Act IV of 1950), which was passed after the Constitution came into effect must be read in the light of article 22 (5) as construed above.\\nSo read, the satisfaction of the authority referred to in section a of the Act cannot be the subjective satisfaction 202 of the authority, for the satisfaction must be founded on grounds which, when communicated later on, will enable the detenu to make a representation which postulates an objective test.\\nThis involves that section 3 (1) (a) of the Act should be read as if the words \\\"on grounds which, when communicated to him, will enable him to make a repre sentation such as is mentioned in section 7 of this Act\\\" occurred after the words \\\"if satisfied with respect to any person\\\" and before the words \\\"that with a view\\\".\\nIf such interpolation of words be not permissible according to accepted canons of construction, then it must be held that in so far as section 3 of the Act makes an order of deten tion dependent on the subjective satisfaction of the author ity, the section is unconstitutional, being repugnant to the provisions of article 22 (5) and the necessary intendment thereof.\\nThe argument so formulated is attractive but on closer scrutiny will be found to be unsound.\\nBefore the Constitution came into force there were laws for the mainte nance of public security in almost all the provinces and in those laws there were provisions similar to the provisions of section 3 of the .\\nIt was held in many cases that in the absence of bad faith, and provided the grounds on which the authority founded its satisfaction had a reasonable relation or relevancy to the object which the legislation in question had in view, the satisfaction of the authority was purely subjective and could not be questioned in any court of law.\\nThe decision of the Federal Court in Machindar Shivaji Mahar vs The King(1) is one of such decisions.\\nVagueness of the grounds on which satisfaction of the authority is founded cannot be treated as on the same footing as the irrelevancy of the grounds, unless the vagueness be such as may, by itself, be cogent evidence in proof of bad faith.\\nIf the grounds are relevant to the objects of the legislation and if there is no proof of bad faith, then mere vagueness of the grounds cannot vitiate the satisfaction founded on them.\\nThe satis faction being subjective, the court (1) at p.831, 203 cannot arrogate to itself the responsibility of judging the sufficiency or otherwise of the grounds.\\nIt is true that at the time those decisions were given the Constitution had not come into force and there were no fundamental rights, but these well established principles were recognised and adopt ed by all members of this court in Gopalan 's case(1) which came up for consideration after the Constitution had come into force.\\nIn that case it was held unanimously that under section 3 of the , the satis faction of the authority was purely subjective and could not, in the absence of proof of bad faith, be questioned at all and that section 3 was not unconstitutional.\\nIt is true that the arguments now advanced were not advanced in exactly the same form on that occasion, but that fact makes no difference, for the arguments have no force as they are founded on the assumption that the grounds on which an order may be made must be such as will, when communicated, be sufficiently full and precise so as to enable the detenu to make a representation.\\nI find no warrant for such an as sumption.\\nIndeed, the fact that this court has held that section 3 of the Act which makes the satisfaction of the authority a purely subjective matter is not unconstitutional clearly destroys the cogency of the argument formulated as hereinbefore stated.\\nThe decision in Gopalan 's case(1) as to the validity of section 3 of the Act makes it impossible to accept this argument.\\nIt is next urged that even if the initial order was not invalid when made because satisfaction was a purely subjec tive matter for the authority alone and the court cannot consider or pronounce upon the sufficiency of the grounds on which the satisfaction was based, nevertheless, the continuance of the detention becomes unlawful if the same grounds when communicated, be found to be vague and devoid of particulars so as to render the making of a representa tion by the detenu somewhat difficult.\\nThe argument is that although the vagueness of the grounds is not (1) ; 204 justiciable at the initial stage when the order is made and so the order cannot be said to be invalid ab initio, the same vagueness of the ground is nevertheless justi ciable at the later stage when they are.\\ncommuni cated, so that if vagueness renders the making of a representation difficult the continuance of the detention at once becomes illegal.\\nUnder article 21 no person can be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law.\\nAs ex plained in Gopalan 's case(1) procedure established by law means procedure enacted by the Legislature, i.e., State made procedural law and not any rule of natural justice.\\nIt was pointed out that the implication of that article was that a person could be deprived of his life or personal liberty provided such deprivation was brought about in accordance with procedure enacted by the appropriate Legislature.\\nHaving so pro vided in article 21, the framers of our Constitution proceeded to lay down certain procedural requirements which, as a matter of constitutional necessity, must be adopted and included in any procedure that may be enacted by the Legislature and in accordance with which a person may be deprived of his life or personal liberty.\\nThose requirements are set forth in article 22 of the Constitution.\\nA perusal of the several clauses of that article will show that the constitutional require ments of procedure which must be incorporated in any law for preventive detention relate to a stage after the order of detention is made under section 3 of the .\\nThe order of detention being thus in accordance with procedure enacted by law which is not inconsistent with, any of the provisions of of the Constitution applica ble to that stage, the order of detention cannot be questioned unless there is proof of bad faith, either direct or indirect.\\nWe have, therefore, to consider whether the detention validly brought about becomes unlawful by reason of subsequent non compliance with the procedural requirements laid down in clause (5) of article 22, for if there is such non compliance, the (1) ; 205 detenu from that moment must be held to be deprived of his liberty otherwise than in accordance with procedure estab lished by law and will, therefore, be entitled to be re leased.\\nI am prepared to concede that there is some correla tion between the two parts of article 22 (5), namely, the communication of the grounds on which the order has been made and the making of the representation by the detained person.\\nThe Constitution insists on the communication of the grounds on which the detention order has been made for some purpose.\\nThat purpose obviously is to apprise the detenu of the reasons for the order of his detention.\\nThe communica tion of the grounds will necessarily enable him, first, to see whether the grounds are at all relevant to the object sought to be secured by the Act.\\nIf they are not, then they were no grounds at all and no satisfaction could be founded on them.\\nThe very irrelevancy of the grounds will be a cogent proof of bad faith on the part of the authority so as to make the order itself invalid.\\nIn the next place, the disclosure of the grounds will tell the detenu in which class his suspected activities have been placed and whether he is entitled to the benefit of having his case scrutinised by the Advisory Board.\\nFinally, the communication of the grounds on which the order has been made will tell him generally the reasons for his detention, and will, there fore, be helpful to the detained person in making his repre sentation which is also provided for in the tatter part of clause (5).\\nThe fact that there is correlation between the two parts of clause (5) does not, however, carry us any further.\\nThere is no warrant for assuming that the grounds to be communicated to the detenu are to be a formal indict ment or a formal pleading setting forth a charge or a case with meticulous particularity nor is there any warrant for the assumption that the representation has to be in the nature of a defence or written statement specifically deal ing with the charge or the case.\\nIndeed, the idea of a trial is foreign to the law of preventive detention.\\nThe very fact that the provisions of clauses (1) and (2) of article 22 206 do not apply to preventive detention clearly excludes the idea of a trial before a tribunal.\\nAs I have said, the grounds will generally indicate the conclusions drawn by the appropriate authority with respect to the suspected activities of any particular person and those grounds, when communicated, will enable the detenu to make a representa tion, for he can easily refer to and set forth his real activities and represent that all his activities are inno cent and cannot possibly give rise to the suspicion indicat ed in the grounds.\\nTo say that clause (5) itself indicates that the grounds must be such as will enable the detenu to make a representation is to read into clause (5) something which is not there.\\nIt is a re statement of the first argu ment in a new form and is fallacious.\\nIn the first place, clause (5) does not in terms say that the authorities shall communicate such grounds as will enable the detenu to make a representation.\\nIn the second place, the decision in Gopa lan 's case(1) militates against this argument, for if the sufficiency of the grounds is not justiciable at the initial stage when the order is made, as held in that case, it is wholly illogical to say that the intention of the Constitu tion is to make the sufficiency of the same grounds justi ciable as soon as they are communicated to the detenu.\\nAs already stated, an order made upon satisfaction founded on vague grounds is quite valid, if the vagueness is not proof of bad faith.\\nUnder clause (5) the authority is to communi cate the grounds on which the order has been made.\\nThis will let the detenu know what operated on the mind of the authority when it made the order.\\nIf the grounds were vague it is the vague grounds that must be communicated, for it was upon those vague grounds that the order had been made.\\nThat is the express provision of the first part of clause (5).\\nThis being the express requirement, the implication that the grounds communicated must be sufficient to enable the detenu to make a representation cannot be read into the clause, for that will militate against the express require ment.\\nIf the order had been made on vague grounds but (1) ; 207 the authority is to communicate precise and well formu lated grounds which will be sufficient for the detenu to make a representation, then the communication will not be of grounds on which the order was made but of something more than what is expressly required.\\nThe express provision must exclude such an inconsistent implied provision.\\nAgain, clause (6)of article 22 gives the authority the right to claim privilege against disclosure of facts in public inter est.\\nNon disclosure of facts will necessarily make the grounds, as communicated, extremely vague and devoid of particulars.\\nIf the construction of clause (5) which is contended for by the detenu 's counsel were correct, then the vagueness of the grounds resulting from the non disclosure of facts under clause will entitle the detenu to be released, for that vagueness also will render the making of a representation impossible or difficult.\\nThat will mean that the claim of privilege given to the authority by clause (6) of article 22 is wholly meaningless and ineffective, and will defeat its very purpose, for the privilege cannot be claimed except at the peril of releasing the detenu.\\nObvi ously that cannot be the intention.\\nIt must, therefore, be held that the vagueness of grounds resulting from non dis closure of facts under clause (6) will not invalidate the order of detention, which was initially valid, on the ground that no representation can be made on the basis of such vague grounds.\\nIn that case by claiming privilege under clause (6) the authority can frustrate the claim of justi ciability of the sufficiency of the grounds.\\nFurther, why should the vagueness of grounds otherwise brought about stand on a different footing ? Clause (5) cannot mean one thing when the privilege is claimed and mean quite the opposite thing when no such privilege is claimed under clause (6).\\nThe initial order is not justiciable.\\nThe claim of privilege is not justiciable.\\nWhy should it be assumed that the sufficiency of grounds for the purpose of making a representation was intended to be justiciable ? I see no logical reason 27 208 for making an assumption which will introduce an objec tive test in a matter which is prima facie intended to be purely subjective.\\nThe argument is then re stated in the following fur ther modified form.\\nClause (5) of article 22 imposes two obligations on the authority making an order of detention, namely, (i) that the authority shall, as soon as may be, communicate the grounds on which the order has been made, and (ii) that the authority shall afford the earliest oppor tunity to the detenu to make a representation against the order.\\nIf the order was made as a result of satisfaction derived in good faith but upon grounds which may be vague, the order will be perfectly good and cannot be challenged in any court.\\nCommunication of such grounds, even if they are vague, will satisfy the first obligation imposed upon the authority.\\nUnder the latter part of clause (5) the authori ty is also under the obligation to afford the earliest opportunity to the detenu to make a representation.\\nIf the grounds on which the order has been made were vague, then the second part of clause (5), independently and without reference to the first part of clause (5), impliedly imposes on the authority an obligation to rectify the defect of vagueness by supplying particulars so as to enable the detenu to make a representation.\\nSupplying of particulars, the argument concludes, is implicit in the second part of clause (5), for without such particulars the detenu is not afforded the opportunity to make a representation.\\nI am unable to accept this line of argument.\\nUnder the first part of clause (5) the grounds on which the order has been made have to be supplied 'as soon as may be. ' The measure of time indicated by the words 'as soon as may be ' must obviously run from the date of detention.\\nLikewise, the latter part of clause (5) requires affording the detenu the earliest opportunity to make a representation.\\nFrom what terminus a quo is the period indicated by the phrase \\\"earli est opportunity \\\"to begin to run ? If that is also to run from the date of the detention, then the two periods under the two parts of clause (5), 209 must necessarily coincide and, therefore, the question of supplying further particulars after the grounds are supplied cannot arise.\\nOn the other hand, the natural meaning of the words of the latter part of clause (5), to my mind, is that the period connoted by the phrase the \\\"earliest opportunity\\\" begins to run from the time the detenu expresses his desire or intention to make a representation.\\nThe making of a representation is the right of the detenu.\\nTo make or not to make a representation is his choice.\\nTherefore, it is only when he decides to make a representation and expresses his desire or intention to make a representation that the earliest opportunity is to be afforded to him to make the desired or intended representation.\\nNow, if the time is to run after the expression of desire or intention on the part of the detenu to make a representation, then the earliest opportunity to be afforded to the detenu can only mean affording him all physical facilities to carry out his desire or intention, for the detenu has decided to make his representation without any further particulars.\\nAccording to the language used in the latter part of clause (5), there is no express provision for supplying particulars.\\nSuppose the grounds on which the order was made and which were communicated to the detenu under the first part were quite precise and sufficient to enable the detenu to make a repre sentation, then affording him the earliest opportunity to make the representation can only mean giving him all physi cal facilities to do so, e.g., by supplying him with paper, pen and ink and when the representation has been drawn up by him, by forwarding the same with due despatch.\\nIn such a case there is no question of supplying further and better particulars.\\nSuppose, again, that the grounds on which the order has been made and which have been communicated to the detenu are regarded by the authority to be quite precise and sufficient for making a representation, is the authority to anticipate that the detenu may find these grounds insuffi cient or that being moved in that behalf the Court may consider them insufficient and 210 then, as soon as the detenu expresses his desire or inten tion to make a representation.\\nis the authority to keep quiet and take the risk of the court releasing the detenu for the vagueness of the grounds or is he to tell the detenu \\\"just wait a little; I think the grounds which I have communicated to you are quite precise and sufficient; lest you or the court find the grounds insufficient for making a representation, I shall supply you with further and better particulars so as to enable you to make the representation ?\\\" The position thus stated is unreal on the face of it.\\nIn my opinion, on a plain reading of clause (5) there is no justification for assuming that a second communication of particulars is contemplated either under the first part or under the second part of clause (5).\\nThis does not, however, mean that the authority may not supply particulars either suo motu or on the application of the detenu.\\nAll that I say is that clause (5) imposes no constitutional obligation on the authority to supply particulars so as to remove the vagueness of the grounds or to enable the detenu to make a representation, and non supply of further particulars does not constitute an infraction of any fundamental right.\\nIt is said that clause (5) of article 22 construed in the way suggested above, would render that clause nugatory for it will then really guarantee no fundamental right at all.\\nI respectfully differ from this view for the criticism does not appear to me to be well founded.\\nCommunication of the grounds, even if vague, will none the less be helpful to the detenu in the several ways I have already mentioned and, therefore, the right to have the grounds on which the order has been made communicated to him is a valuable right which has been recognised as a fundamental right.\\nLikewise, the right to make a representation is a valuable right which is guaranteed by the Constitution.\\nThese rights remain unaffected.\\nIf the the provisions of clause (5) of article 22 of our Constitution on a correct interpretation thereof are found to be inadequate for the protection of the liberty of 211 the detenus it is their misfortune.\\nThe Constitution which the people have given unto themselves is the supreme law and must be upheld and obeyed whether ' or not one likes its provisions, inhibitions and necessary implications.\\nThe court can only draw the, attention of the Parliament to the lacuna or defect, if any, in the Constitution and in the Act so that the lacuna may be supplied or the defect remedied in the constitutional way.\\nOur attention has been drawn to a number of cases where under various provincial laws and before the Constitution the different High Courts have directed the release of the detenu on the basis of the vagueness of the grounds.\\nThose decisions are, however, distinguishable because they were based on legislation which required the communication not only of grounds but also of particulars.\\nThe omission from our Constitution of the provision for communicating the particulars in addition to the grounds which were to be found in those laws is significant, for it may be deliber ate.\\nApart from this, however, those decisions do not appear to me to have any bearing on the correct interpreta tion of our Constitution or of the .\\nIn Iswar Das vs The State(1) the question was not raised or argued as it was made clear in the judgment itself.\\nIn view of what I have stated above, I am of the opinion that as the grounds originally communicated to the detenu were relevant to the objects which the Act had in view and as there is no proof of mala fides the obligations cast upon the authorities under article 22 (5) which have been reproduced in section 7 of the have been fully complied with.\\nEven according to the views expressed by the majority of my colleagues I would be pre pared to hold that the particulars subsequently supplied along with the grounds originally supplied fully enable the detenu to make his representation.\\nIn my opinion there has been no contravention of the fundamental rights of the detenu.\\nI would, therefore, (1) Not reported.\\n212 allow this appeal and reverse the decision of the Bombay High Court.\\nAppeal allowed.

Mattoo filed another writ petition being Civil Writ Petition No. 29 of 1982 challenging the advertisement on the ground that the revised qualifications had not been validly prescribed and as such the post of Principal could only be filled on the basis of the pre revised qualifications.\\nAccording to him the revised qualifications were advertised only to make him ineligible for the post.\\nThe main thrust of Mattoo 's argument was that his earlier writ petition was decided by the High Court on October 29, 1981 wherein the counsel for the Management conceded that he possessed the requisite qualifications for the post of Principal.\\nAdmit tedly Matto does not possess the revised qualifications.\\nAccording to him the earlier writ petition was filed in the year 1979 and had the qualifications been revised by amend ing the rules in 1978, the counsel for the management would have certainly brought the same to the notice of the Court and since it was not done there was factually no amendment to the rules.\\nThe High Court accepted the contention of Mattoo and allowed the writ petition by its judgment dated June 9, 1988 on the following reasoning: \\\"It is stated in para No. 13 of their counter that qualifi cations were changed in August, 1978 with the approval of the Govt.\\nof India.\\nThis statement is not accepted for two reasons one, that this was not the defence of the respond ents in writ petition No. 256/1979 in which petitioner 's eligibility was granted by the High Court for the post of Principal; and second, that after the decision of the High Court granting eligibility to the petitioner for the post of Principal in writ petition No. 256/1979, the respondents plea on the basis of some policy or note whereby qualifica tions were changed in 1978 prior to the filing of the writ petition No. 256/1979 cannot be now pressed into service nor would be permitted to be made because same will be barred by doctrine of constructive res judicata.\\n\\\" The High Court quashed the advertisement dated January 5, 520 1982 and restrained the management from filling the post of Principal on the basis of the impugned advertisement.\\nThe management has come up to this Court in appeal against the above said judgment of the High Court of Jammu and Kashmir.\\nThe learned counsel for the appellant has invited our attention to the proceedings of the meeting of the manage ment of the School held on August 22, 1978.\\nIt was decided in the said meeting that the person selected for the. post of Principal of the School must have academic background in Buddhist Philosophy in addition to the qualifications pre scribed under the Rules.\\nThereafter the amended qualifica tions which have been reproduced above were prescribed by the Board of Management.\\n3 It is not disputed that the recruitment Rules could be altered by the Board of Management at any time with the sanction of the Government of India.\\nMr. E.C. Agarwala appearing for the respondent M.L. Mattoo has, however, contended that the recruitment rules were never amended and in any case there was no sanction of the Government of India regarding the amended Rules.\\nLearned counsel for the appellant has invited our atten tion to the affidavit of Dr. (Mrs.) Kapila Vatsyayan, Chair man, Board of Management of the School filed before the High Court.\\nDr. Kapila Vatsyayan is the Additional Secretary to Government of India in the Ministry of Education and Cul ture.\\nPara 13 of the affidavit is as under: \\\"When in the year 1978, the question of appointment of a Principal of the school on regular basis was under the consideration of the Board of Management, it was held that keeping in view the objects of the school being a research Institution to propogate Buddhist Philosophy a thorough academic background in Buddhist Philosophy was considered as one of the essential qualifications for the post of Princi pal of the School as will be evident from the extract from brief note on Agenda item I considered in the meeting of the Board of Management held on 22nd August, 1978 Annexure IV.\\nShri Tashi Paljore was appointed as Principal as stated in para No. 5 of the petition as he possessed this qualifica tion and was selected by a duly appointed Selection Commit tee.\\nThe contention of the petitioner that this qualifica tion has been added now after the decision of writ petition No. 256 of 1979 is incorrect.\\nAs 521 stated above, the qualifications were changed in August 1978 with the approval of Govt.\\nof India.\\nThese qualifications are obviously very necessary for the fulfilling of the objectives of the Schools of Buddhist Philosophy, Leh (Ladakh).\\nIn the absence of these qualifications, the very object for which the Institution exists is bound to be defeated.\\nThe qualification has been provided the interest of the Institution and for the attain ment of the object for which it exists, namely imparting and propagating Buddhist Philosophy.\\nThe Recruitment Rules of 1975, Annexure 'D ' to the petition were framed by the Board at that time.\\nUnder the Rules and Regulations of the Board, the Board of Management is competent to amend the same. ' ' it is obvious from the affidavit of Dr. Kapila Vatsyayan reproduced above that the qualifications for the post of Principal were revised by amending the Rules and the revised qualifications were approved by the Government of India.\\nNo. 1 rejoinder was filed by M.L. Mattoo to the above affidavit, The High Court was not justified in disbelieving the contents of the affidavit.\\nThe rules are not statutory.\\nThe Board of Management is fully competent to alter or amend the rules in any manner and at any time.\\nThe affidavit by the Chairman of the Board of Management who is additional Secre tary to Government of India to the effect that the rules were amended in 1978 with the approval of the Government of India, should have put an end to the controversy.\\nWe have no hesitation in holding that the qualifications for the post of Principal of the School stood validly revised by the amendment of the Rules in August, 1978.\\nSince respondent No. 1 Shri M.L. Mattoo does not possess the revised qualifica tions, he is not eligible to be considered for the said post.\\nIn the earlier writ petition No. 256/1979 the question as to whether the qualifications for the post of Principal had been revised was not before the High Court.\\nThe main contention of the Management, before the High Court, was that the Management society was not a 'State ' under Article 12 and as such no writ petition was competent.\\nAt the hear ing the counsel for the management, however, conceded that the society was a 'State ' under Article 12 of the Constitu tion of India.\\nIt is no doubt that the High Court has men tioned that it 522 was admitted by the counsel for the Management that Mattoo possessed the requisite qualifications for the post but we do not understand how in the face of categoric affidavit of Dr. Kapila Vatsyayan such a statement could be made before the High Court.\\nWe, therefore, hold that the qualifications/experience for the post of Principal were validly revised by amending the Rules in August, 1978.\\nThe advertisement issued on January 5, 1982 was in accordance with the Rules and the High Court was not justified in quashing the same.\\nWe, therefore, allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the High Court and dismiss the writ petition filed by M.L. Mattoo before the High Court.\\nThere shall be no order as to costs.\\nY. Lal Petition dismissed. [/INST] Appointments to various posts in School of Budhist Philosophy, Leh, were governed by the Rules framed by the Board of management in the year 1973.\\nAccording to the said rules, the qualifications prescribed for the post of Princi pal as also for the Administrative Officer were identical.\\nIn March 1973, one M.L. Mattoo, Respondent No. 1, who at that time was working as the Administrative Officer of the School was given the additional charge of the post of Prin cipal.\\nThereafter the Board of management at its meeting held on 22.8.1978, decided that qualifications prescribed for the post of Principal should be revised, so as to make it obligatory for the Principal to have a thorough academic knowledge of Buddhist Philosophy the primary object of the institution being research and propagation of Budhist phi losophy.\\nA selection committee was constituted by the Board of management to appoint a suitable person as Principal of the school and one Tashi Paljor, was appointed as Principal.\\nBeing aggrieved by the said appointment, Respondent No. 1, filed a writ petition in the High Court contending that he was removed from the additional charge without affording him an opportunity of being heard and further that he was not considered by the selection committee.\\nThe High Court re jected the first contention but allowed the writ petition on the ground that he was not considered for the post of Prin cipal and thus his right under Article 16 was infringed.\\nThereupon the management advertised the post of Principal to be filed by direct recruitment on the basis of the revised qualifications.\\nRespondent Mattoo challenged the advertise ment by means of a writ petition on the ground that the revised qualifications were not validly prescribed and as such the post of Principal could only be filled in on the basis of the pre revised qualifications.\\nHe based his con tention on the concession made by the counsel for the man agement, when his earlier petition was heard, that the petitioner possessed the requisite qualifications.\\nAccording to him the rules have not been amended.\\nThe High Court accepted the contention of Mattoo 516 and allowed the writ petition, quashed the impugned adver tisement and directed the management not to make appointment on the basis of the advertisement in question.\\nHence this appeal by the Board of management of the school.\\nAllowing the appeal, this Court, HELD: The Board of management is fully competent to alter or amend the rules in any manner and at any time.\\n[521E] The qualifications/experience for the post of Principal were validly revised by amending the rules in August 1978.\\nThe advertisement issued on January 5, 1982, was in accord ance with the Rules and the High Court was not justified in quashing the same.\\n[522B] Since respondent No. 1 does not possess the revised qualifications, he is not eligible to be considered for the said post.\\n[521F] </s>\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Mehta for the Respondents.\\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by VENKATARAMIAH, CJ.\\nThe petitioners in these petitions have questioned the validity of a notification issued by the Government of Gujarat on June 26, 1985 in exercise of its powers conferred by Section 15 of the (67 of 1957), herein after referred to as the Act, amending the Gujarat Minor Mineral Rules 1966, hereinafter referred to as the Rules, with effect from 1 7 1985 substituting the original rule 21 of the Rules by a new rule which reads as follows: \\\"21.\\nRate of Royality: The holder of a quarry lease or any other mineral concession granted under these rules shall pay royalty in respect of minor minerals, specified in column 2 of the schedule, removed or consumed by him or by his agent, manager, employee, contractor or sub lessee from the leased area at the rates respectively specified against them in column 3 of the said schedule.\\nProvided that: (i) the holder of a Parwana granted under these rules shall pay royalty at the rate of fifty percent of the rate of royalty specified in the said schedule.\\n(ii) no royalty shall be charged from Nimbha das of village potters who manufacture upto one lakh bricks per year.\\n(iii) no royalty shall be charged from Nimbha das of village potters if their annual produc tion is not exceeding two lakhs bricks and they supply at least one lakh bricks to the Rural Housing Board or Panchayats.\\n(iv) Royalty shall be recoverable in whole rupees, fraction fifty paise and above to be rounded upwards to a whole rupee and fraction below fifty paise shall be ignored\\\" and fixing the royalty payable by the lessees in respect of minor minerals known as Black Trap and Hard Murrum at Rs.7 per metric tonne by amending schedule of the Rules which was being levied at Rs. 4 till the date of the said amendment.\\n409 In order to understand the case of the petitioners it is necessary to set out some other provisions of law governing the case.\\nThe Act was passed in the year 1957 by Parliament to provide for the regulation of mines and development of minerals under the control of the Union and it was made applicable to the whole of India.\\nUnder section 3A of the Act the word 'minerals ' is defined as including all minerals except mineral oils.\\nClause (e) of the said section defines 'minor minerals ' as building stones, gravel, ordinary clay, ordinary sand other than sand used for prescribed purposes and any other mineral which the Central Government may.\\nby notification in the Official Gazette, declare to be a minor mineral.\\nIt is not disputed that Black Trap and Hard Murrum are notified as minor minerals.\\nThe Act has made provision with regard to the issue of prospecting licences and mining leases in respect of various kinds of minerals other than minor minerals and the procedure to be followed in that connection in the matter of issue of prospecting licences and mining leases.\\nSection 9 of the act empowers the Central Government to levy royalty in respect of the minerals which are won by the mining lease holders under the Act at the rates prescribed in the Second Schedule to the Act.\\nIt empowers the Central Government to enhance or reduce the rate of royalty prescribed by the Second Schedule in respect of any mineral subject to the condition that the Central Government shall not enhance the rate of royalty in respect of any mineral more than once during any period of three years.\\nSection 14 of the Act provides that sections 5 to 13 (inclusive) shall not apply to quarry leases, mining leases or other mineral concessions in respect of minor minerals.\\nSection 15 as it stood during the relevant time read thus: \\\"15.\\n(1) The State Government may, by notifi cation in the Official Gazette, make rules for regulating the grant of (quarry leases, mining leases or other mineral concessions) in re spect of minor minerals and for purposes connected therewith.\\n(2) Until rules are made under sub section (1), my rules made by a State Government regulating the grant of (quarry leases, mining leases or other mineral concessions) in re spect of minor minerals which are in force immediately before the commencement of this Act shall continue in force.\\n(3) The holder of a mining lease or any other mineral concession granted under any rule made under sub section (1) 410 shall pay royalty or dead rent, whichever is more in respect of minor minerals removed or consumed by him or by his agent, manager, employee, contractor or sub lessee at the rate prescribed for the time being in the rules framed by the State Government in respect of minor minerals; Provided that the State Government shall not enhance the rate of royalty in respect of any minor mineral for more than once during any period of three years.\\n\\\" It is seen from section 15 that the State Government is empowered to make rules for regulating the grant of quarry leases, mining leases or other mineral concessions in re spect of minor minerals and for purposes connected there with.\\nIn exercise of the said power under section 15 the Government of Gujarat promulgated the Gujarat Minor Minerals Rules, 1966 which are referred to as the Rules as stated above.\\nRule 21 of the Rules provides for the determination of the rate of royalty payable in respect of minor minerals.\\nThe original rule 21 was substituted by new rule 21 by the issue of impugned notification on 26 6 1985 which provides that a holder of a quarry lease or any other mineral conces sion granted under the Rules shall pay royalty in respect of minor minerals provided in column 2 of the Schedule, removed or consumed by him or by his agent, manager, employee, contractor or sub lessee from the leased area at the rates specified in column 3 of the said Schedule.\\nIt is under this notification the rate of royalty in respect of black trap and Hard Murrum was increased from Rs. 4 to Rs.7 per metric tonne.\\nThe rule also provides that the holder of a Parwana granted under the Rules shall pay royalty at the rate of 50 per cent of the rate of royalty specified in the said Sched ule and that no royalty shall be charged from Nimbhadas of village Potters who manufacture upto one lakh bricks per year.\\nIt further provides that no royalty shall be charged from Nimbhadas of villages potters if the annual production is not exceeding two lakh bricks and they supply at least one lakh bricks to the Rural Housing Board or Panchayats.\\nThe validity of rule 21 as it existed prior to the issue of the impugned notification was considered in B.K. Trivedi & Sons and Ors.\\nvs State of Gujarat and Ors.\\n, ; as under the said rule the royalty payable in respect of some of the minor minerals had been enhanced.\\nOriginally all lessees had to pay a minimum dead rent in respect of the area covered by a minor mineral lease issued in respect of any minor mineral or the royalty prescribed in respect of quantity of minor minerals owned by him, which ever was higher.\\nThe history of the legislation of the Rule from the year 1986 is set out in detail in the said 411 decision.\\nHence it is not necessary to refer to it in detail here.\\nBy the said decision the constitutionality of section 15 of the Act and the validity of a notification issued on June 18, 1981 under which the rate of royalty had been raised was upheld and the writ petitions in which the said validity had been questioned were dismissed.\\nThat decision was rendered on March 5, 1986.\\nDuring the pendency of the said petitions in the High Court the impugned notification was issued increasing the royalty payable in respect of Black Trap and Hard Murrum from Rs.4 to Rs.7.\\nIn these petitions the impugned notification issued in the year 1985 is questioned.\\nSince many of the contentions raised by the parties in respect of the constitutionality of section 15 of the Act and the validity of Rules made thereunder had been considered and the contentions urged by the petitioners against the said rule in those petitions had been rejected, in the present case the petitioners have confined their case only to the following points which according to them had not been considered in the said decision.\\nShri R.F. Nariman, learned counsel for the petitioners in some of the petitions had two contentions: 1. that the royalty levied and covered under the Rules should be applied only for mineral development and since the said royalty is being treated as part of the consolidated fund of the State and used for other purposes by the State the levy was bad; and 2.\\nthat the impugned notification in question was in contravention of clause (b) of Article 304 of the Constitution.\\nThe contention of the learned counsel was that under Entry 50 of List II of the 7th Schedule to the Constitution, the royalty recovered by the State Government had to be used only for mineral development and could not be used for any other purpose.\\nAccording to him the Act had been passed for purposes of regulation and development of minerals.\\nHe depended upon the language of Entry 50 which reads thus: \\\"taxes on mineral rights subject to any limitations imposed by Parliament by law relating to mineral development\\\" We do not find much substance in this contention.\\nRe cently a Constitution Bench of this Court has held in The India Cement Ltd. etc.\\nvs The State of Tamil Nadu etc., [1989] 4 S.C. Judgments Today 190 that the royalty levied on the extracted mineral was in the nature of a tax and it was not in the nature of a fee which could be used 412 only for specific purposes.\\nAny tax realised by the State Government forms part of the consolidated fund of the State and the said tax can be used by the State Government for any of the purposes to which its executive powers extend subject to any law made by the State Legislature in that regard.\\nWe do not, therefore, find any substance in the above conten tion.\\nIt is no doubt true that the Act is passed for devel opment of minerals, but while discharging its functions relating to development, if the State incidentally allows mining to be carried on in the public interest and levies in that connection a tax, it does not mean that the said tax should be used only for development of minerals and not for other purposes sanctioned by law.\\nIn support of the second contention the learned counsel Shri Nariman argued that notwithstanding anything contained in Article 301 or Article 303 the Legislature of a State may by law impose such reasonable restrictions on the freedom of trade, commerce or intercourse with or within that State as required in the public interest.\\nProvided that no Bill or amendment for the purpose of sub clause (b) shall be intro duced or moved in the legislature of a State without the previous sanction of the president.\\nWe do not find that clause (b) of Article 304 has any relevance on the point in question.\\nNo restriction is being imposed on the freedom of trade of the petitioners by the levy of royalty.\\nThe minerals belong to the Government and if anybody wants to have the right as a lessee to exploit the mines in question to the exclusion of all others and to remove the minerals with a view to making profit, he has to pay a royalty imposed in accordance with law.\\nIn the instant case the levy is made under a law made by the Central Gov ernment.\\nIt is not an imposition made by a law made by the State Legislature on which alone the restriction contemplat ed under Article 304(b) applies.\\nWe do not also find much substance in the contention that the levy in question is unreasonably heavy and has been imposed in an arbitrary manner.\\nThe burden of establishing that the levy is unreasonably heavy, is on the petitioners.\\nIt is urged that in the other States the royalty is being levied at the rate of Re. 1 per metric tonne of Black Trap and Hard Murrum and Rs.7 levied in the notification is excessive.\\nThe fact that in other States the royalty is fixed at Re. 1 is not by itself sufficient to hold that Rs.7 per metric tonne is unreasonably high rate of royalty.\\nIn Trivedi 's case (supra) this Court had upheld the levy of Rs.4 per metric tonne which had been fixed in 1981 and in 1985 it was increased to Rs.7.\\nHaving regard to the depreci ation in the value of 413 the rupee and the increase in the cost of ' administration of the State, which is ever increasing, as a welfare State we cannot say that Rs.7 is an unreasonably high rate.\\nWe have taken this view after going through the observations made by this Court in Trivedi 's case (supra) at page 544 where this Court has observed that where a statute confers discretion ary powers upon the executive or an administrative authori ty, the validity or constitutionality of such power cannot be judged on the assumption that the executive or such authority will act in an arbitrary manner in the exercise of the discretion conferred upon it.\\nIf the executive or the administrative authority acts in an arbitrary manner, its action would be bad in law and liable to be struck down by the courts but the possibility of abuse of power or arbi trary exercise of power cannot invalidate the statute con ferring the power or the power which has been conferred by it.\\nWe do not find that the levy is arbitrarily imposed.\\nIt is obvious that the petitioners are lessees who are exploiting the mining areas for purposes of business and that the royalty in question is ultimately passed on to the consumers.\\nIt is not shown that the business ,of the peti tioners has been adversely affected in such a way that it is liable to be struck down on the ground of arbitrariness.\\nWe do not, therefore, find any substance in the contention urged by Shri Nariman.\\nIn Civil Writ Petition No. 618 of 1987 filed by Jai Sholanath Quarry Works and another, Mr. Keswani, learned counsel for the petitioners contended that the impugned rule 21 which was substituted in the place of the former rule 21 was invalid as it was discriminatory in character.\\nHe con tended that the concession shown in favour of Parwana hold ers was discriminatory and violative of Article 14.\\nUnder clause 1 of the proviso to the impugned rule 21, a holder of a Parwana granted under the Rules has to pay royalty at the rate of 50 per cent of the royalty payable by the lessees and no royalty is payable by village potters who manufacture upto one lakh bricks per year and by the village potters whose annual production was not exceeding two lakh bricks and who supply at least one lakh bricks to the Rural Housing Board or Panchayats.\\nHis contention was that section 15 of the Act which authorised the State Government to make rules in respect of minor minerals does not specifically authorise the State Government to make such discrimination.\\nWe find no substance in this contention too.\\nIt is obvious that a valid classification of persons and things for 414 purposes of imposing any obligation on them would not be violative of Article 14 provided the classification is a reasonable one.\\nIt is well settled that a classification to be valid has to satisfy two conditions: (1) that there is an intelligible differentia between those who are included in the class which is affected by any law or rule and those who are placed outside the said rule; and (2) that there is a reasonable nexus between the classification and the object to be achieved by the rule or law in question.\\nThe Act under the Rules was made for purposes of regu lation and development and conservation of minerals.\\nIt is equally clear that while levying a tax the authority con cerned is entitled to grant concessions and exemptions wherever necessary having regard to the purpose of the Act, the levy of royalty is incidental to the regulation and development of minerals.\\nMany a time absence of such classi fication may itself result in the invalidation of the law or rule.\\nWhoever is given an exclusive right to exploit a mine will have to pay some amount by way of return to the Govern ment of India as authorised by entry 50 of List II of the 7th Schedule to the Constitution.\\nHaving regard to the broad policy underlying the Constitution if a concession is shown in favour of the poor and the down trodden, it cannot be said that the exemption or concession is invalid.\\nAccording to rule 2(vi)(a) of the Rules a \\\"quarrying Parwana\\\" means a quarrying Parwana granted under these rules to extract and remove any minor mineral from land not exceeding a specified area.\\nRule 33 A provides that the competent officer may notify areas of limestone, Black Trap, sand stone and build ing stones for the purpose of grant of quarrying parawana, as he deems fit.\\nWhen any area is so notified, no quarry lease shall be granted for such notified area.\\nRule 33 B of the Rules reads thus: \\\"33.B. Grant of quarrying Parwana On an application made to the competent officer, he may grant a quarrying Parwana to extract and remove from the specified area within his jurisdiction the minor mineral from a plot not exceeding 2,000 square meters, as may be specified by the competent officer.\\nThe compe tent officer may grant such Parwana in the following priorities: (a) Individual families to Khanias belonging to the Scheduled Castes or the Scheduled Tribes, who do physical work I of excavating minor mineral in the area applied for. 415 (b) Individual families of 'Khanias ' who do physical work in excavating minor minerals in the area applied for.\\n(c) New individual Khanias who do physical work in excavating minor minerals in any other areas.\\n\\\" Rule 33 C provides that the lease shall be granted for one year ending 31st December on a payment of a fee of Rs.50 for an area upto 1,000 square meters and Rs. 100 for an area above 1,000 square meters and upto 2,000 square meters.\\nThus it is seen that a Parwana can be given only respect of plots not exceeding 2,000 square meters and for a limited period of one year.\\nIt is only in the case of such people who are described in the Rules and who invariably belong to the weaker sections of society the concession is shown under rule 21, whereas the mining lease may be given to persons mentioned in rule 9.\\nUnder rule 18 of the Rules the period of lease in the case of the minor minerals can be for a much longer period, it can be upto 10 years in respect of minor minerals except in the case of ordinary sand, Kankar, Mur ram, Gravel and in the case of Kankar, Murram and gravel a lease can be granted upto three years, and the area or land covered by a mining lease is governed by rule 15 which says that no quarry lease shall be granted for an area exceeding 10 hectares in case of specified minor mineral and 20 hec tares in the case of other minerals.\\nSo a comparison of the relevant rules would show that a larger restriction is imposed both on the area in respect of which a Parwana could be issued and the duration of the Parwana right and as also stated that the persons who take quarrying Parwana are persons belonging to the weaker sections of society and if under rule 21 a concession is shown in their favour it cannot be said that there is no reasonable nexus between the classification for purposes of the proviso to rule 21 to show concession in the matter of payment of royalty and the social policy underlying the Constitution, the statute and the Rules.\\nThe fact that section 15 of the Act does no authorise the State Government to show such concession while promulgating the Rules which are in the nature of subordi nate legislation is also of no consequence.\\nSince the power exercised is legislative in character the authority which is exercising the said power has the power to make rules equi table by necessary implication.\\nNo express power need to conferred on such subordinate authority in order to make a classification for purposes of implementing the policy of the Act under which the Rules are made.\\nWe do not also agree with the contention that levying of royalty in the State of Gujarat on the minor minerals would impose in any way 416 the freedom guaranteed under Article 301 of the Constitution regarding movement of goods from one State to another for the activity of quarrying does not involve any movement as such.\\nThe mineral may be consumed inside the State and in some cases may latter on be taken outside the State.\\nBut the movement outside the State is not the direct consequence of quarrying.\\nWe do not, therefore, find any substance in any of the contentions urged before us.\\nThese petitions are dismissed with costs.\\nEach of the petitioners shall pay a sum of Rs.2,000 by way of costs to the State of Gujarat.\\nY.

C. Dutt on behalf of the Board by virtue of the powers conferred on him by certain rules to which we shall refer later.\\nOn June 4, 1965 the Company preferred a writ petition under article 226 of the Constitution in the Punjab High Court for the issue of a writ of mandamus or other appropriate writ, direction or order quashing the order of the Board dated May 19, 1965.\\nThe Managing Director, Mr. Balasubramanian joined in the petition as petitioner No. 2.\\nThe writ petition is directed against 7 respondents, the first of which is the 318 Company Law Board.\\nThe second respondent is Mr. T. T. Krishnamachari, who was at that time Minister for Finance in the Government of India.\\nThe Inspectors: appointed are respondents 3 to 6 and Mr. Dang is the 7th respondent.\\nApart from the relief of quashing the order of May 19, 1965 the appellants sought the ' issue of a writ restraining the Company Law Board and the Inspectors from giving effect to the order dated May 19, 1965 and also sought some other incidental reliefs.\\nThe order of the Board was challenged on 5 grounds which are briefly as follows: (1) that the order was made mala fide; (2) that in making the order the Board had acted on material extraneous to the matters mentioned in section 237(b) of the ; (3) that the order having in fact been made at the instance of the shareholders is invalid and on a true construction of section 237 this could not be done; (4) that the order was invalid because it was made by the Chairman of the Board and not by the Board; and (5) that the provisions of section 237(b) are void as offending articles 14 and 19(1) (g) of the Constitution.\\nThe allegations of mala fides were denied on behalf of the respondents.\\nThey disputed the validity of all the other grounds raised by the petitioners.\\nThe High Court rejected the contentions urged before it on behalf of the appellants and dismissed the writ petition.\\nThe appellants thereafter sought to obtain a certificate of fitness for appeal to this Court; but the High Court refused to grant such a certificate.\\nThey have now come up to this Court by special leave.\\nIn order to appreciate the arguments addressed before us a brief statement of the relevant facts would be necessary.\\nThe Company was registered in the year 1961 and had an authorised capital of Rs. 1 crore divided into 1,00,000 shares of Rs. 100 each.\\nIts primary object was to carry on business of manufacturing all types of barium compounds.\\nAppellant No. 2 was appointed Managing Director of the Company from December 5, 1961 and his appointment and remuneration were approved by the Central Government on July 30, 1962.\\nThe erection of the plant was undertaken by M/s. L. A. Mitchell Ltd., of Manchester in pursuance of a collaboration agreement between it and the company entered in October, 1961 and approved by the Central Government in November of that year.\\nThereafter a permit for importing the requisite machinery was granted to the Company.\\nThe issued capital of the Company was Rs. 50, 00,000 and the public was invited to subscribe for shares in the Company.\\nIt is said that the issue was oversubscribed by March 12, 1962.\\n319 It would see that soon after the collaboration agreement was entered into M/s. L. A. Mitchell Ltd., was taken over by a financial group (M/s. Pearwn, & Co. Ltd.), to which a. person named Lord Poole belonged.\\nIt would appear that as the work of setting up of the plant was being delayed the Company sent a notice to M/s Mitchell Ltd. , on April 2, 1965 in which the Company stated that if the plant was not completely installed and got into running order by June 1, 1965 the Company will have to make alternative arrangements and that it would hold M/s. L. A. Mitchell Ltd., liable to pay damages to the Company for the loss suffered by it.\\nAs a result of the notice Lord Poole visited India in April/May, 1965.\\nIn his opinion the design of the plant was defective.\\nCertain negotiations took place between the Company and Lord Poole in the course of which an undertaking was given by Lord Poole on at behalf of the collaborators that the work would be completed with necessary alterations and modifications in accordance with the report of M/s. Humphrey & Co., and that the collaborators would spend an additional amount upto pound 250,000 as may be required for the purpose.\\nIt is said that the plaint was producing at that time only 25 per cent of its installed capacity but that according to the assurance given by Lord Poole it would yield full production by April, 1966.\\nAccording to the appellants, before entering into a collaboration agreement with M/s. L. A. Mitchell Ltd., the appellant No. 2 Balasubramanian was negotiating with a German firm named Kali Chemie A. G. of Hanover for obtaining their collaboration.\\nIt is said that the firm of M/s. T. T. Krishnamachari & Sons were and still are the sole agents in India for some of the products of Kali Chemie.\\nThe firm of T. T. Krishnamachari & Sons approached appellant No. 2 for the grant of sole selling, agency of the products of the plant to be established in collaboration with Kali Chemie.\\nAppellant No. 2 did not agree to this with the result that the company 's negotiations with Kali Chemie broke down.\\nThe appellants also say that T. T. Krishnamachari & Sonswere later a so granted a licence to set up a plant for manufacturing barium chemicals but that on appellant No. 2 bringing certainfacts: to the notice of Mr. Nehru the licence in favour of T. T. Krishnamachari & Sons was revoked.\\nThe relevance of these facts is in connection with the plea of mala fides.\\nOn this part of the case the appellant 's contention is that the Chairman of the Company Law Board Mr. R. C. Dutt made the order for investigation into the affairs of appellant No. 1 at the instance of Mr. T. T. Krishnamachari, the then Finance Minister and also because of his bias against appellant No. 2.\\nThe suggestion is that as the licence of M/s. T. T. Krishnamachari & Sons was revoked and as they were not even given sole selling agency for the sale of the products of barium chemicals Mr. T. T. Krishnaniachari wanted action to be taken under this provision either for penalising appellant No. 1 or putting pressure on it.\\n320 A lengthy argument was addressed before us by Mr. Setalvad bearing on the question of mala fides in the course of which he referred us to certain documents.\\nHe also wanted us to bear in mind the sequence in which certain events occurred and said that these would indicate that the former Finance Minister must have been instrumental in having an order under section 237(b) made by the Chairman of the Board.\\nWe were, however, not impressed by this argument.\\nOur learned brother Shelat has dealt with this aspect of the matter fully in his judgment and as we agree with him it is not necessary to say much on the point.\\nWe would, however, like to refer to and deal with one aspect of the argument bearing on the question of mala fides.\\nMr. Setalvad points out that the Company Law Board had decided in December 1964 to take action against appellant No. I under section 237(b) and had actually obtained approval of Mr. T. T. Krishnamachari to the proposed action.\\nTherefore, according to him the real order is of Mr. Krishnamachari even though the order is expressed in the name of the Board.\\nWe find no substance in the argument.\\nThe decision to take action was already taken by the Chairman and there is nothing to indicate that in arriving at that decision he was influenced by the Finance Minister.\\nIf the decision arrived at by the Chairman was an independent one it cannot be said to have been rendered mala fide because it was later approved by Mr. Krishnamachari whose sons undoubtedly constitute the partnership firm of M/s. T. T. Krishnamachari & Sons.\\nIt is also suggested by Mr. Setalvad that the action approved of in December, 1964 was delayed till May, 1965 because in the interval some negotiations with Kali Chemie had been started and had they ended fruitfully M/s. T.T. Krishnamachari & Sons would have got the sole selling agency of the products of barium chemicals.\\nNow it does seem from ,certain material brought to our notice that negotiations with Kali Chemie were revived by appellant No. 2 because of the difficulties which were being experienced in the working of the collaboration agreement with M/s. L. A. Mitchell Ltd. No material, however, is placed before us from which it could be reasonably inferred that had the negotiations with Kali Chemie fructified M/s. T. T. Krishnamachari & Sons would have secured the sole monopoly for sale of the products of barium chemicals.\\nOne more point was urged in connection with this aspect of the argument and it is that the appellants were not given an opportunity to cross examine Mr. T. T. Krishnamachari and Mr. Dutt.\\nIn our opinion, in a proceedingunder article 226 of the Constitution the normal rule is, as pointedout by this Court in The State of Bombay vs Purshottam Jog Naik to decide disputed questions on the basis of affidavits and that it is within the discretion of the High Court whether to allow a person who has sworn an affidavit before it as indeed Mr. Krishnamachari and Mr. Dutt have to be cross examined or not to permit it.\\nIn exercise of.\\nits discretion the High Court has re 321 fused permission to cross examine them.\\nIn such a case it would not be appropriate for this Court while hearing an appeal by special leave to interfere lightly with the exercise of that discretion.\\nMr. Setalvad said that as the appellants had made out a prima facie case of mala fides in their affidavits, and as these allegations had been denied by the respondents, the High Court was in error in refusing permission to the appellants to cross examine the persons who swore the affidavits on the side of the respondents.\\nWe are not aware of the rule on which Mr. Setalvad bases himself.\\nThere is nothing to show that the High Court thought that a prima facie case of mala fides had been made out.\\nEven in such a case a court might well hold that it has been demolished by the affidavits in answer.\\nThe court has to find the facts and if it finds that it can do so without cross examination it is not compelled to permit cross examination.\\nWe have no reason to think that the High Court could not have ascertained the facts on the affidavits themselves.\\nComing to the second point, it would be desirable to repro duce section 237 which reads thus: \\\"Without prejudice to its powers under section 235 the Central Government (a) shall appoint one or more competent persons as inspectors to investigate the affairs of a company and to report thereon in such manner as the Central Government may direct, if (i) the company, by special resolution, or (ii) the Court, by order, declares that the affairs of the company ought to be investigated by an inspector appointed by the Central Government; and (b) may do so if, in the opinion of the Central Government, there are circumstances suggesting (i) that the business of the company is being conducted with intent to defraud its creditors, members or any other persons, or otherwise for a fraudulent or unlawful purpose, or in a manner oppressive of any of its members, or that the company was formed for any fraudulent or unlawful purpose; or (ii) that persons concerned in the formation of the company or the management of its affairs have in connection therewith been guilty of fraud, misfeasance or other misconduct towards the company or towards any of its members; or (iii) that the members of the company have not been given all the information with respect to its 322 affairs.\\nwhich they might reasonably expect, including information relating to the calculation of the commission payable to a managing or other director, the managing agent, the secretaries and treasurers, or the manager of the company.\\n\\\" In view of the fact that the Central Government, by virtue of the powers conferred by sections 10 E and 637 delegated its powers under section 237 to them Company Law Board we shall read section 237 as if in place of the words \\\"Central Government\\\" there are the words \\\"Company Law Board\\\" or for brevity 'Board '.\\nAccording to Mr. Setalvad, cl.\\n(b) of section 237 requires two things: (1) the opinion of the Board and (2) the existence of circumstances suggesting one or more of the matters.\\nspecified in sub cls.\\n(i) to (iii).\\nHe contends that though the opinion of the Board is subjective the existence of circumstances set out in the sub cls.\\n(i) to (iii) is a condition precedent to the formation of the opinion.\\nTherefore, according to him, the Court is entitled to ascertain whether in fact any of those circumstances exists.\\nThe Attorney General disputes this construction and contends that the clause is incapable of a dichotomy and that the subjective process embraces the formation of an opinion that circumstances suggestive of any of the matters comprised in sub cls.\\n(i) to (iii) exist.\\nOnce it is conceded that the formation of an opinion by the Board is intended to be subjective and if the provision is constitutional which in our view it is the question would arise: what is that about which the Board is entitled to form an opinion? The opinion must necessarily concern the existence or non existence of facts suggesting the things mentioned in the several sub clauses of cl.\\nAn examination of the section would show that cl.\\n(b) thereof confers, a discretion upon the Board to appoint an Inspector to investigate the affairs of a company.\\nThe words \\\"in the opinion of\\\" govern the words \\\"there are circumstances suggesting\\\" and not the words \\\"may do so\\\".\\nThe words 'circumstances ' and 'suggesting ' cannot be dissociated without making it impossible for the Board to form an 'opinion ' at all.\\nThe formation of an opinion must, therefore, be as to whether there are circumstances suggesting the existence of one or more of the matters in sub cls.\\n(D to (iii) and not about any thing else.\\nThe opinion must of course not have been arrived at mala fide.\\nTo say that the opinion to be formed must be as to the necessity of making an investigation would be making a clear departure from the language in which section 237(b) is couched.\\nIt is only after the, formation of, certain opinion by the Board that the stage for exercising the discretion conferred by the provision is reached.\\nThe discretion conferred to order an investigation is administrative and not judicial since 323 its exercise one way or the other does not affect the rights of a company nor does it lead to any serious consequences as, for instance, hampering the business of the company.\\nAs has been pointed out by this Court in Raja Narayanalal Bansilal vs Maneck Phiroz Mistry & Anr.(1) the investigation undertaken under this provision is for ascertaining facts and is thus merely exploratory.\\nThe scope for judicial review of the action of the Board must, therefore, be strictly limited.\\nNow, if it can be shown that the 'Board had in fact not formed an opinion its order could be successfully challenged.\\nThis is what was said by the Federal Court in Emperor vs Shibnath Banerjee(2) and approved later by the Privy Council.\\nQuite obviously there is a difference between not forming an opinion at all and forming an opinion upon grounds, which, if a court could go into that question at all, could be regarded as inapt or insufficient or irrelevant.\\nIt is not disputed that a court can,not go into the question of the aptness or sufficiency of the grounds ,upon which the subjective satisfaction of an authority is based.\\nBut, Mr. Setalvad says, since the grounds have in fact been disclosed in the affidavit of Mr. Dutt upon which his subjective satisfaction was based it is open to the court to consider whether those grounds are relevant or are irrelevant because they are extraneous to the question as to the existence or otherwise of any of the matters referred to in sub cls.\\n(i) to (iii).\\nLet us now examine the affidavit of Mr. Dutt.\\nSince this affidavit is in answer to the allegations made in the writ petition the two ;should be considered together.\\nIn paragraphs 1 to 19 of the writ petition certain facts and figures concerning the formation, registration etc.\\nof the company, the activities of the company and other related matters have been set out.\\nThese were admitted by Mr. Dutt in paragraph 14 of the counter affidavit.\\nParagraph 20 onwards of the writ petition deals with the action taken by the Board and the various grounds on which according to the appellants the action of the Board is open to challenge.\\nThe first 4 paragraphs of the counter affidavit deal with certain formal matters.\\nIn paragraph 5 Mr. Dutt has set out that the petition is liable to be dismissed summarily being grounded on facts which are, false, speculative and lacking in material particulars.\\nThereafter he has set out what, according to him, are the true facts.\\nIn paragraphs 6 to 8 he has dealt with the legal aspects of the case.\\nThe 8th paragraph is the most important amongst them.\\nHere Mr. Dutt has stated that it was not competent to the Court to go into the question of adequacy or otherwise of the material on the basis of which orders under section 237(b) are passed by the Board.\\nThen he stated: 'However, if in spite of what has been stated and contrary to the submissions above, this Han 'ble Court still holds that it is necessary for the Court to examine the relevant material in (1)[1961] I S.C.R. 417.\\n(2)[1944] F.C.R. 1.\\n324 order to do justice, then the Board would have no objection to producing the same for the Court 's perusal provided it is not shown to the petitioners.\\n\\\" It may be mentioned that the Court did not call for this material at all nor did the appellants seek its production.\\nIn paragraph 9 Mr. Dutt has categorically stated that the order of May 19, 1965 was passed after careful and independent examination of the material by the Chairman and that it was issued in proper exercise of the powers conferred upon it.\\nHe has specifically denied that it was issued at the instance of the second respondent.\\nIn paragraph 10 Mr. Dutt has taken the plea that the petition was liable to be dismissed as it had not been made bona fide but for extraneous reasons and to create prejudice with a view to thwart statutory investigation.\\nThen he has set out the circumstances upon which his contention is based.\\nIn paragraph 13 he has stated that without prejudice to his submissions in the earlier paragraphs he would reply to allegations contained in the various paragraphs of the writ petition.\\nThen follows paragraph 14 upon which Mr. Setalvad has founded an argument that the grounds disclosed therein being extraneous the order is invalid.\\nIn this paragraph Mr. Dutt has admitted some of the facts stated in paragraphs 1 to 19.\\nHe has also said that the Board was aware of the fact that the company had entered into collaboration with M/s. L. A. Mitchell Ltd. He has then added:. . but it has no information of any of the other matters and/or negotiations with M/s. L. A. Mitchell Ltd., Manchester.\\nHowever, from the Memoranda received by the Board referred to in paragraph 5 and other examination it appeared inter alia that: (i) that there had been delay, bungling and faulty planning of this project, resulting in double expenditure.\\nfor which the 'collaborators had put the responsibility upon the Managing Director, Petitioner No. 2: (ii) Since its flotation the company has been continuously showing losses and nearly 1/3rd of its share capital has been wiped off; (iii)that the shares of the company which to start with were at a premium were being quoted on the Stock Exchange at half their face value; and (iv)some eminent persons who had initially accepted seats on the Board of Directors of the company had subsequently severed their connections with it due to differences with Petitioner No. 2 on account of the manner in which the affairs of the company were being conducted.\\n\\\" In paragraph 5 it may be recalled Mr. Dutt has set out the grounds on which the writ petition deserved to be summarily 325 rejected.\\nIt will thus be clear that what are characterised by Mr. Setalvad as the grounds upon which the order of the Board is based are nothing more than certain conclusions drawn by the Boar& from some of the material which it had before it.\\nMoreover the expression \\\"inter alia\\\" used by Mr. Dutt would show that the conclusions set out by him specifically are not the only ones which could be drawn from the material referred to by, him in paragraph 5 of his affidavit.\\nTurning to paragraph 16 of the affidavit we find that Mr. Dutt has clearly reiterated that there was ample material before the Board on which it could and did form the opinion that there were circumstances suggesting that as stated in the order of May, 19, 1965, the business of the company was being conducted with intent to defraud creditors, members and other persons and further that the persons concerned in the management of the affairs of the company had in connection therewith been guilty of fraud, misfeasance and other misconduct towards the company and its members.\\nThis paragraph is in answer to paragraph 21 of the writ petition.\\nIt is in that paragraph alone that the appellants had specifically raised the contention that the recital in the order as to the existence of material is not correct and that in point of fact there was no material before the Board to form the said opinion.\\nIn this state of pleadings it would not be right to construe the affidavit of Mr. Dutt to mean that the only conclusions emerging from the material before the Board are those that are set out in paragraph 14 of his affidavit.\\nApart from this we do not think that the conclusions set out in paragraph 14 are extraneous to the matters indicated in the order of May 19, 1965.\\nWhat is said therein is that there are circumstances suggesting that the business of the appellants is being conducted with intent to defraud its creditors, members and others, and that.\\nthe persons concerned with the management of the affairs of the company have been guilty of fraud, misfeasance and other misconduct towards the company and its members.\\nit has to be borne in mind that what the Board is to be satisfied about is whether the circumstances suggest any of these things and not whether they establish any of these things.\\nNow, the first of its conclusion is to the effect that the materials show that there was delay , bungling, faulty planning of the project and that this resulted in double expenditure for which the collaborators had put the responsibility upon the Managing Director, that is, appellant No. 2.\\nWould it be farfetched to say that these circumstances could reasonably suggest to the Board that these happenings were not just pieces of careless conduct but were deliberate acts or omissions of appellant No. 2 done with the ulterior motive of earning profit for himself ? Similarly could not the fact that the company was continuously showing losses since its flotation and that 1/ 3rd of its 326 share : capital had ,been wiped out could have been suggestive of fraud to the Board.\\nIn 'this connection, we think it right to point out that the spirit of the section must be kept in mind in determining its interpretation.\\nThe section was enacted to prevent the Management of a company from acting in a manner prejudicial to the interests of the shareholders for whom it was difficult,to get together and take steps for the protection of their interests jointly.\\nIt was this difculty of the shareholders which is a reality which had led to the enactment of the section.\\nThere is no doubt that few share holders have the means or ability to act against the Management.\\nIt would furthermore be difficult for the shareholders to find out the facts leading to the poor financial condition of a company.\\nThe Government thought it right to take power to step in where there was reason to suspect that the Management may not have been acting in the interests of the shareholders who would not be able to take the steps against a powerful body like the Managementand to take steps for protection of such interests.\\nAs we have said, the section gives the exploratory power only.\\nIts object is to find out the facts.\\n, a suspicion having been entertained that all was not well with the company.\\nThe powers are exercised for ascertaining facts and, therefore, before they are finally known, all that is necessary for the exercise of the powers is the opinion ,of the Board that there are circumstances which suggest to it that fraud and other kinds of mismanagement mentioned in sub cls.\\n(i) to (iii) of cl.\\n(b) of the section may have been committed.\\nIf the facts do reasonably suggest any of these things to the Board, the power can be exercised,though another.\\nindividual might think that : the ;facts suggest otherwise It cannot be said that from a huge loss incurred by a company and the working of the company in a disorganised and un businegslike way, the only conclusion possible is that it was due to lack of capability.\\nIt is reasonably ,conceivable that the result had been produced by fraud and other varieties of dishonesty or misfeasance.\\nThe order does not amount to a finding of fraud.\\nIt is to find out what kind of wrong ,action has led to,the company 's ill fate that the powers under the sectional given.\\nThe enquiry may reveal that.the renovation or other similar kind of malfeasance.\\nIt would be destroying the beneficial effective use of the powers given by the section to say that the Board must first show that a fraud can clearly be said to have.been committed.\\nIt is enough that the facts show that it can be reasonably thought that the company 's unfortunate position might have been caused by fraud and other species of dishonest action.\\nIn our opinion, therefore, the argument of Mr. Setalvad about the circumstances being extraneous cannot be accepted.\\nComing to the third point of Mr. Setalvad pointed out that four ex Directors of the Company who had resigned submitted a 327 memorandum to Mr. T. T. Krishnamachari while he was holding the office of Finance Minister in which grave allegations were made concerning the affairs of the Company and the management of the Company by the second appellant.\\nThe investigation, according to Mr. Setalvad.\\nwas the outcome of this memorandum and that by ordering it the Board has in effect enabled the ex Directors who continue to be shareholders to circumvent the provisions of sections 235 and 236 of the .\\nSection 235 deals with \\\"Investigation of affairs of company on application by members or report by Registrar\\\".\\nClause (a) of this section provides that in the case of a company having a share capital the investigation can be ordered either on the application of not less than 200 members or of members holding not less than one tenth of the total voting power therein.\\nWe are not concerned with cls.\\n(b) and (c).\\nApparently the four ex Directors were not holding 10% of the voting power of the Company.\\nAt any rate the case was argued on this footing.\\nSection 236 provides that such application has to be supported by such evidence as the Board (reading 'Board ' for 'Central Government ') may require.\\nIt also empowers the Board to require the applicants to furnish security for such amount, not exceeding one thousand rupees as it may think fit, for the payment of the costs of the investigation.\\nThe contention is that though the Board acted upon the memorandum submitted by four ex Directors it did not even require them to comply with the provisions of section 236.\\nThe contention is that the order of the Board appointing Inspectors is invalid.\\nIn other words the argument amounts to this that the provisions of section 237(b) have been utilised by the Board as a cloak for taking action under the provisions of section 235.\\nIn other words this is an argument that the order was made mala fide.\\nIt is true that a memorandum was presented to Mr. Krishna machari by four ex Directors containing grave allegations against the two appellants.\\nBut it was not solely on the basis of this memorandum that action was taken by the Board.\\nIt is clear from the counter affidavit of Mr. Dutt and particularly from paragraph 5 thereof that the Board had before it not only two sets of memoranda dated May 30, 1964 and July 9, 1964 respectively from four ex Directors of the Company alleging serious irregularities and illegalities in the conduct of the affairs of the Company but also other materials.\\nThe Board points out that over a long period beginning from September 1961 the Department had been receiving various complaints in regard to the conduct of the affairs of the Company.\\nOne complaint had also been received by the Special Police Establishment and forwarded by it to the Department in November, 1963.\\nThe matter was enquired into by the Regional Director of the Board at Madras and he, in his report, sent to the Board in September 1964 suggested an urgent and comprehensive investigation into the affairs of the Company.\\nIn his /S5SCI 23 328 affidavit the Chairman of the Board Mr. Dutt has stated further in paragraph 5(b) as follows: \\\"The material on the file was further examined in the light of the Regional Director 's recommendation by the two Under Secretaries of the Board (Sarvashri M. K. Banerjee C. section section and K. C. Chand, I. R. section at the head.\\nquarters of the Board in New Delhi and both of them endorsed the recommendation of the Regional Director to order an investigation.\\nThe matter was then considered by the Secretary of the Company Law Board in charge of investigation (Shri D. section Dang, I.A.S.) and he also expressed his agreement that there was need for a deeper probe into the affairs of the company.\\n\\\" Then again in paragraph 5(c) he has stated as follows: \\\"Accordingly, the matter was put up to me at the end of November 1964 and after consideration of all the material on record, I formed the opinion that there were circumstances suggesting the need for action under section 237(b) of the \\\".\\nIt is abundantly clear from all this that the investigation cannot be said to have been ordered either at the instance of the four ex Directors or on the sole basis of the memoranda submitted by them.\\nThere is, therefore, no contravention of the provisions of SS. 235 and 236 of the Act.\\nAs a corollary to this it would follow that the order was not made mala fide or is otherwise invalid.\\nAs already stated the appellant had challenged the provisions of section 237(b) on the ground that they are violative of the fundamental rights under articles 14 and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution.\\nOur brother Shelat has dealt with this attack on the provisions fully and we agree generally with what he has said while dealing with the contentions.\\nWe would, however, like to add that the com pany being an artificial legal person cannot, as held by this Court in The State Trading Corporation of India Ltd., vs Commercial Tax Officer Visakhapatnam & Ors.(1),claim the benefit of the provisions of article 19(1)(g) though appellant No. 2 Balasubramanian can do so.\\nWe agree with our learned brother that the action proposed under section 237(b) being merely, exploratory in character the fundamental right of Balasubramanian to carry on business is not affected thereby.\\nSince that is so, the question whether the pro visions of the aforesaid section are a reasonable restriction on the exercise of the right under article 19(1)(g) does not arise for consideration.\\nIn the circumstances, therefore, we do not think that there is anything more that we need say.\\nThe last question is whether it was not competent to Mr. Dutt alone to take the decision that an investigation be ordered against the company.\\nIn taking the decision Mr. Dutt acted under a rule 1964] 4 S.C.R. 99. 329 of procedure prescribed in the order dated February 6, 1964.\\nThe validity of this rule is challenged, by Mr. Setalvad on the ground that this amounts to sub delegation of a delegated power and is ultra vires the Act.\\nClause (a) of sub section\\n(1) of section 637 read with section 10(E)(1) empower the Central Government to delegate its powers under section 237 to the Company Law Board.\\nBy notification dated February 1, 1964 the Central Government has delegated, amongst other powers and functions, those conferred upon it by section 237 upon the Company Law Board.\\nBy another notification of the same date the Central Government has made and published rules made by it in exercise of its powers under section 642(1) read with section 10E(5) rule 3 of which reads thus: \\\"Distribution of business; The Chairman may, with the previous approval of the Central Government, by order in writing, distribute the business of the Board, among himself and the other member or members, and specify the cases or classes of cases which shall be considered jointly by the Board.\\n\\\" By order dated February 6, 1964 the Chairman of the Company Law Board specified the cases and classes of cases to be considered jointly by the Board and distributed the remaining business between himself and other members of the Board.\\nAmongst the matters allocated to the Chairman is the appointment of an Inspector under section 237 to investigate the affairs of a company.\\nThis, Mr. Setalvad says\\\" could not be done in the absence of an express provision in the Act.\\nIn this connection he has referred us to sub section\\n4A of section 10E which was subsequently added but not made retrospective by an amendment of the Act which confers an express power on the Central Government to enable the Chairman to distribute the powers and functions of the Board.\\nAccording to the learned Attorney General this provision was enacted only to make what was implicit in section 10E(5) read with section 642(1) clear and that the distribution of the work of the Board being merely a matter of procedure the order of the Chairman allocating the power under section 237(b) to himself did not amount to sub delegation of the power of the Board.\\nBearing in mind the fact that the power conferred by section 237(b) is merely administrative it is difficult to appreciate how the allocation of business of the Board relating to the exercise of such power can be anything other than a matter of procedure.\\nStrictly speaking the Chairman to whom the business of the Board is allocated does not become a delegate of the Board at all.\\nHe acts in the name of the Board and is no more than its agent But even if he is looked upon as a delegate of the Board and, therefore, a sub delegate vis a vis the Central Government he would be as much subject to the control of the Central Government as the Board itself.\\nFor sub section\\n(6) of section 10E provides that the Board shall, in S5SCI 23(a) 330 the exercise of the powers delegated to it, be subject to the control of the Central Government and the order distributing the business was made with the permission of the Central Government.\\nBearing in mind that the maxim delegatus non potest delegare sets out what is merely a rule of construction, sub delegation can be sustained if permitted by an express provision or by necessary impli cation.\\nWhere, as here, what is sub delegated is an administrative power and control over its exercise is retained by the nominee of Parliament, that is, here the Central Government, the power to make a delegation may be inferred.\\nWe are, therefore, of the view that the order made by the Chairman on behalf of the Board is not invalid.\\nTo sum up, then, our conclusions may be stated thus: The discretion conferred on the Central Government by section 237(b) to order an investigation and delegated by it to the Company Law Board is administrative, that it could be validly exercised by the Chairman of the Board by an order made in pursuance of a rule enacted by the Central Government under section 642(1) read with section 10E(5), that the exercise of the power does not violate any fundamental right of the company, that the opinion to be formed under section 237(b) is subjective and that if the grounds are disclosed by the Board the Court can examine them for considering whether they are relevant.\\nIn the case before us they appear to be relevant in the context of the matter mentioned in sub cls.\\n(i) to (iii) of section 237(b).\\nThough the order could successfully be challenged if it were made mala fide, it has not been shown to have been so made.\\nThe attack on the order thus fails and the appeal is dismissed with costs.\\nHidayatullah, J. We are concerned in this appeal with the legality of an order of the Chairman, Company Law Board, May 19, 1965, (purporting to be under section 237(b) of the ) declaring that the affairs of the Barium Chemicals Ltd. be investigated.\\nAs a consequence Inspectors have been appointed and searches have been made.\\nThe Company and its Managing Director filed a petition under article 226 of the Constitution in the High Court of Punjab seeking to quash the order and on failure there, have filed this appeal by special leave of this Court.\\nThe action of the Chairman was and is challenged on diverse grounds but those which were presented before us were few and clear cut.\\nThe action is challenged as without jurisdiction because not the Board but the Chairman alone acted, as mala fide because no honest opinion was formed on the matters which under the section give rise to the power but on irrelevant and extraneous material, and further because the order was passed under the influence and malice of a Minister of Cabinet who was interested in another Company belonging to his sons and sought this means to oust a rival.\\nThe facts have been stated already in some detail by my brother Shelat and I need not take time in restating them.\\nMy 331 order proposed by him but as I view the matter a little differently on some of the aspects of the case, I wish to record my reasons briefly.\\nUnder the , a power of superintendence over the affairs of Companies is retained by the Central Government in much the same way as the Board of Trade in England exercise over Companies in that country.\\nThis power is of two kinds (a) calling for information or explanation from the Company and (b) ordering an investigation into the affairs of the Company by appointment of Inspectors for inspection, investigation and report.\\nThe power is not only varied but is capable of being exercised variously.\\nThe power to call for information is conferred on the Regisrar in two different ways.\\nFirstly, jurisdiction is conferred on the Registrar by section 234 to call for information or explanation in relation to any document submitted to him, which information or explanation must be furnished on pain of penalties.\\nIf the information or explanation is not furnished or is unsatisfactory the Registrar can report to the Central Government for action.\\nSecondly, if a contributory, creditor 'or other person interested places materials before the Registrar (a) that the business of the Company is being carried on in fraud of its creditors or of persons dealing with the Company or (b) otherwise for a fraudulent or unlawful purpose, the Registrar can, after hearing the Company, call upon it to furnish any information or explanation.\\nA further power is conferred after December 28, 1960, on the Registrar, who may, after being authorised by a Presidency Magistrate or a Magistrate First Class, enter any place, search and seize any document relating to the Company, its managing agents, or Secretaries and treasurers or managing director or manager, if be has reason to believe that it may be destroyed or tampered with.\\nSections 235 251 provide for investigation of the affairs of a company and for sundry matters related to such investigations.\\nThey follow the scheme of sections 164 175 of the English Act of 1948.\\nSection 235 enables the Central Government to appoint inspectors for investigation and report generally if the Registrar reports under section 234 and also if a stated number of shareholders or shareholders possessing a stated voting power apply.\\nWhen ' members apply they must support their application by evidence and give security for costs of investigation.\\nIn the present case no action under any of the sections noted so far was taken but it was taken under section 237.\\nThis section is in two parts.\\nThe first part which is (a) compels the Central Government to appoint inspectors to investigate and report if the company by a special resolution or the court by order declares that the affairs be investigated.\\nThe second part which is (b) gives a discretionary power, As this dis 332 cretionary power was in fact exercised this is a convenient place to read part (b) of section 237.\\nIt reads: \\\"237.\\nWithout prejudice to its powers under section 235, the Central Government (a) (b) may do so (i.e. appoint one or more competent persons as inspectors to investigate etc.) if, in the opinion of the Central Government, there are circumstances suggesting (i) that the business of the company is being conducted with intent to defraud its creditors, members or any other persons, or otherwise for a fraudulent or unlawful purpose, or in a manner oppressive of any of its members, or that the company was formed for any fraudulent or unlawful purpose; (ii) that persons concerned in the formation of the company or the management of its affairs have in connection therewith been guilty of fraud, misfeasance or other misconduct towards the company or towards any of its members; or (iii) that the members of the company have not been given all the information with respect to its affairs which they might reasonably expect, including information relating to the calculation of the commission payable to a managing or other director, the managing agent, the secretaries and treasurers, or the manager, of the company.\\nBy section 237(b) the power is conferred on the Central Government but under the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1963 a Board of Company Law,, Administration consisting of a Chairman and a member has been set up.\\nThis Board is constituted under section 10E which has been introduced in the parent Act.\\nThe section may be read here: \\\"10E. Constitution of Board of Company Law Administration.\\n(1) As soon as may be after the commencement of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1963, the Central Government shall, by notification in the Official Gazette, constitute a Board to be called the Board of Company Law Admin istration to exercise and discharge such powers and functions conferred on the Central Government by or under this Act or any other law as may be delegated to it by that Government.\\n333 (2) The Company Law Board shall consist of such number of members, not exceeding five, as the Central Government deems fit, to be appointed by that Government by notification in the Official Gazette.\\n(3) One of the members shall be appointed by the Central Government to be the chairman of the Company Law Board.\\n(4) No act done by the Company Law Board shall be called in question on the ground only of any defect in the constitution of, or the existence of any vacancy in, the Company Law Board.\\n(5) The procedure of the Company Law Board shall be such as may be prescribed.\\n(6) In the exercise of its powers and discharge of its functions, the Company Law Board shall be subject to the control of the Central Government.\\nThe Board was constituted on February 1, 1964 by a notification and by a notification of even, date in exercise of the powers conferred by cl.\\n(a) of sub section\\n(1) of section 637 read with sub section\\n(1) of section 10E of the , the Central Government delegated its powers and functions to the Board under section 237(b) among others.\\nSimultaneously acting in exercise of the powers conferred by sub section\\n(1) of section 642 read with sub section\\n(5) of section 10E the Central Government made the Company Law Board (Procedure) Rules, 1964 and one such rule dealt with distribution of business to the following effect: \\\"3.\\nDistribution of business The Chairman may, with the previous approval of the Central Government, by order in writing, distribute the business of the Board among himself and the other member or members, and specify the cases or classes of cases which shall be considered jointly by the Board.\\n\\\" The Chairman by an order dated February 6, 1964 specified the cases or classes of cases which are to be considered jointly by the Board and distributed the remaining business of the Board between the Chairman and the member each acting individually.\\nThe power under section 237 was placed among the powers exercisable by the Chairman singly.\\nThat is how action was taken in the name of the Board but by the Chairman and is the subject of challenge for the reason that a power delegated to the Board as a whole cannot be delegated to an individual member in the absence of a provision such as sub section\\n(4A) added recently to section 10E enabling the solidarity of the Board to be broken.\\nSub section (4A) of section 10E, which has been added by an amending Act of 1965, after the events in this case, reads: \\\"10E. (4A).\\nThe Board.\\nwith the previous approval of the Central Government, may, by order in writing, 334 authorise the chairman or any of its other members or its principal officer (whether known as secretary or by any other name) to exercise and discharge, subject to such conditions and limitations, if any, as may be specified in the order, such of its powers and functions as it may think fit; and every order made or act done in the exercise of such powers or discharge of such functions shall be deemed to be the order or act, as the case may be, of the Board.\\n\\\" This sub section enables the work of the Board to be distributed among members while sub section\\n(5) merely enables the procedure of the Board to be regulated.\\nThese are two very different things.\\nOne provides for distribution of work in such a way that each constituent part of the Board properly authorised, becomes the Board.\\nThe other provides for the procedure of the Board.\\nWhat is the Board, is not a question which admits of solution by procedural rules but by the enactment of a substantive provision allowing for a different delegation.\\nSuch an enactment has been framed in relation to the Tribunal constituted under section 10B and has now been framed under section 10E also.\\nThe new sub section involves a delegation of the powers of the Central Government to a member of the Board which the Act previously allowed to be made to the Board only.\\nThe statute, as it was formerly, gave no authority to delegate it differently or to another person or persons.\\nWhen it spoke of procedure in sub section (5) it spoke of the procedure of the Board as constituted.\\nThe lacuna in the Act must have been felt, otherwise there was no need to enact sub section (4A).\\nThe argument of the learned Attorney General that sub section\\n(4A) was ?lot needed at all, does not appeal to me.\\nIt is quite clear that its absence would give rise to the argument accepted by me, which argument is unanswerable in the absence of a provision such as the new sub section.\\nMy brother Shelat has dealt with this aspect of the case fully and I cannot add anything useful to what he has said.\\nI agree with him entirely on this point.\\nI shall now consider the question of mala fides.\\nThis arises in two different ways.\\nThere is first mala fides attributed to the chairman because he is said to have acted under the behest of a Minister of Cabinet interested in another rival Company.\\nIt is not necessary to go into it.\\nThe Chairman obtained the opinion of quite a few of his assistants (perhaps more than was altogether necessary) and this fact is stated to establish his fairness to and honest dealing with the Company.\\nThere is nothing to show that this was done on purpose to cover up a conspiracy to do harm to the Company.\\nOn the other hand I cannot overlook the fact that the rival Company itself had obtained a licence to manufacture Barium Chemicals which it allowed to lapse.\\nThis shows that rivalry between two manufacturing concerns was not the prime 335 motive.\\nNo doubt the rival Company had tried to obtain the sole selling rights of, and even a share in, this Company.\\nThis might have weighed with me but for the fact that the Company itself had done nothing even before action was taken, to establish itself.\\nThe whole project had hung fire and capital was eaten into a rapid rate because there were technical defects in the setting up of the plant and machinery.\\nThere was not much hope of profits as a sole selling agent or even as a partner.\\nIn these circumstances, I cannot go by the allegations made against the Chairman of the Board personally or those made against the Minister, and I find no evidence to hold that dishonesty on the part of the one or malice on the part of the other lies at the root of this action.\\nThis brings me to the third and the last question, namely, whether mala fides or the ultra vires nature of the action has been established in this case to merit interference at our hands.\\nIn view of my decision on the question of delegation it is hardly necessary to decide this question but since contradictory opinions have been expressed on it by my brethren Mudholkar and Shelat.\\nI must give my views on this matter.\\nThe question naturally divides itself into two parts.\\nThe first is whether there was any personal bias, oblique motive or ulterior purpose in the act of the chairman.\\nThe second is what are the powers of the Board in this behalf and whether they have been exercised contrary to the requirements of the Act.\\nThe first ground has already been dealt with in part when I considered the malice and influence of the Minister.\\nIt may be said at once, that apart from that allegation, nothing has been said attributing to the Chairman any personal bias, grudge, oblique motive or ulterior purpose.\\nEven in the arguments it was not suggested that the Chairman acted from improper motives.\\nTherefore, all that I have to consider is whether the action of the Chairman can be challenged as done either contrary to the provisions empowering him or beyond those provisions.\\nIn dealing with this problem the first point to notice is that the power is discretionary and its exercise depends upon the honest formation of an opinion that an investigation is necessary.\\nThe words \\\"in the opinion of the Central Government\\\" indicate that the opinion must be formed by the Central Government and it is of course implicit that the opinion must be an honest opinion.\\nThe next requirement is that \\\"there are circumstances suggesting etc.\\n\\\" These words indicate that before the Central Government forms its opinion it must have before it circumstances suggesting certain inferences.\\nThese inferences are of many kinds and it will be useful to make a mention of them here in a tabular form: (a) that the business is being conducted with intent to defraud (i) creditors of the company, or (ii) members, 336 or (iii) any other person; (b) that the business is being conducted (i) for a fraudulent purpose or (ii) for an unlawful purpose; (c) that persons who formed the company or manage its affairs have been guilty of (i) fraud or (ii) misfeasance or other misconduct to wards the company or towards any of its members.\\n(d) That information has been withheld from the members about its affairs which might reasonably be expected including calculation of commission payable to (i) managing or other director, (ii) managing agent, (iii) the secretaries and treasurers, (iv) the managers.\\nThese grounds limit the jurisdiction of the Central Govern ment.\\nNo jurisdiction, outside the section which empowers the initiation of investigation, can be exercised.\\nAn action, not based on circumstances suggesting an inference of the enumerated kind will not be valid.\\nIn other words, the enumeration of the inferences which may be drawn from the circumstances, postulates the absence of a general discretion to go on a fishing expedition to find evidence.\\nNo doubt the formation of opinion is subjective but the existence of circumstances relevant to the inference as the sine qua non for action must be demonstrable.\\nIf the action is questioned on the ground that no circumstance leading to an inference of the kind contemplated by the section exists, the action might be exposed to interference unless the existence of the circumstances is made out.\\nAs my brother Shelat has put it trenchantly: \\\"It is not reasonable to say that the clause permitted the government to say that it has formed the opinion on circumstances which it thinks exist. . . .\\nSince the existence of \\\"circumstances\\\" is a condition fundamental to the making of an opinion, the existence of the circumstances.\\nif questioned, has to be proved at least prima facie.\\nIt is not sufficient to assert that the circumstances exist and give no clue to what they are because the circumstances must be such as to lead to conclusions of certain definiteness.\\nThe conclusions must relate to an intent to defraud, a fraudulent or unlawful purpose, fraud or misconduct or the withholding of information of a particular kind.\\nWe have to see whether the Chairman in his affidavit has shown the existence of circumstances leading to such tentative 337 conclusions.\\nIf he has, his action cannot be questioned because the in reference is to be drawn subjectively and even if this Court would not have drawn a similar inference that fact would be irrelevant.\\nBut if the circumstances pointed out are such that no inference of the kind stated in section 237(b) can at all be drawn the action would be ultra vires the Act and void.\\nNow the Chairman in his affidavit referred to two memoranda dated May 30, 1964 and July 4, 1964 presented by certain ex directors and also stated that from September 1961 complaints were being received in regard to the conduct of the affairs of the Company, and one such complaint was received from Special Police Establishment in November 1963.\\nThe nature of the complaints was not disclosed but in reference to the memoranda it was stated that \\\"irregularities\\\" and \\\"illegalities\\\" in the conduct of the affairs of the Company was alleged therein.\\nIt was also stated that the memoranda \\\"were supported by documentary evidence and details of the impugned transactions and the signatories offered to produce witnesses with knowledge of these transactions\\\".\\nThis was followed by an enquiry by the Regional Director of the Board at Madras (Shri R. section Ramamurthi, I.A.S.) who made a report in September 1964.\\nThe report was next considered by two Under Secretaries arid by the Secretary of the Company Law board who all agreed \\\"that there was need for a deeper probe into the affairs of the Company\\\".\\nThe matter was then placed before the Chairman who formed the opinion that there were circum stances suggesting the need for action under section 237(b).\\nNone of the reports was produced.\\nNor was there any indication in the affidavit what their drift was.\\nThere was considerable delay in taking up the matter and this was explained as occasioned by the language riots, and other more pressing occupation.\\nIt appears that in the High Court an offer was made to place the reports etc.\\nin the hands of the Court provided they were not shown to the other side, but no such offer was made in this Court.\\nThe High Court did not look into the documents.\\nHad the matter rested there it would have been a question whether this Court should interfere with a subjective opinion, when the affidavit showed that there were materials for consideration.\\nIt would then have been a question whether this Court could or should go behind the affidavit.\\nI leave that question to be decided in another case where it arises.\\nIn this case it is not necessary to decide it because the affidavit goes on to state: \\\". . .\\nHowever from the Memoranda received by the Board referred to in paragraph 5 and other examination it appeared inter alia that: (i) there had been delay, bungling and faulty planning of this project, resulting in double expenditure, for which the collaborators had put the responsibility upon the Managing Director, Petitioner No. 2, 338 (ii) Since its floatation the company has been continuously showing losses and nearly 1/3rd of its share capital has been wiped off; (iii) that the shares of the company which to start with were at a premium were being quoted on the Stock Exchange at half their fa ce value; and (iv) some eminent persons who had initially accepted seats on the Board of directors of the company had subsequently severed their connections with it due to differences with Petitioner No. 2 on account of the manner in which the affairs of the company were being conducted.\\n\\\" Paragraph 14 of the affidavit).\\nIt may be mentioned that in paragraph 16 of the affidavit the Chairman also stated: \\\"With reference to paragraph 21 of the petition, I have already stated above that there was ample material before the Board on which it could and did form the opinion that there were circumstances suggesting that the business of the company was being conducted with intent to defraud its creditors, members and other persons and further that the persons concerned in the management of the affairs of the company had in connection therewith been guilty of fraud, misfeasance and other misconduct towards the company and its members.\\n\\\" The question thus arises what has the Chairman placed before the Court to indicate that his action was within the four corners of his own powers? Here it must be noticed that members are ordinarily expected to take recourse to the Registrar because there they have to be in a certain number or command a certain proportion of the voting power.\\nThey are also required to give evidence and the Company gets an opportunity to explain its actions.\\nIf section 237(b) is used by members, as an alternative to section 236, the evidence must unerringly point to the grounds on which alone action can be founded.\\nIn my opinion there is nothing to show that the, reports which were being received from September 1961, or the report of the Special Police Establishment indicated fraud.\\nillegality or action or actions with intent to defraud, as contemplated by the section.\\nThe affidavit merely says that these reports indicated the need for a deeper probe.\\nThis is not sufficient.\\nThe material must suggest certain inferences and not the need for \\\"a deeper probe\\\".\\nThe former is a definite conclusion the latter a mere fishing expedition.\\nA straight forward affidavit that there were circumstances suggesting any of these inferences was at least necessary.\\nThere is no such affidavit and the reason is that the Chairman completely misunderstood his own powers.\\nThis is indicated by the enumeration of the four circumstances, I have extracted from his affidavit and I proceed to analyse them.\\n339 The first circumstance is \\\"delay, bungling and faulty plan ning\\\" resulting in \\\"double expenditure\\\" for which the collaborators had put the responsibility on the second appellant.\\nNone of these shows an intent to defraud by which phrase is meant something to induce another to act to his disadvantage.\\nThe circumstances mentioned show mismanagement and inefficiency which is not the same thing as fraud or misconduct.\\nThe second and the third circumstance merely establish that there was loss in making this project work and that a part of capital had been lost.\\nThis was admitted by the appellants who pointed out that after considerable negotiations they induced Lord Poole, the President of the collaborating firm, to invest a further sum of pound 25,000.\\nThis shows that the appellants were in a position to dictate to the collaborating company which they would not have been able to do if they were guilty of fraudulent conduct.\\nThe last circumstance does not also bear upon the subject of fraud and acts done with intend to defraud.\\nthat some directors have resigned does not establish fraud or misconduct.\\nThere may be other reasons for the resignation.\\nIn the other part of the affidavit the Chairman has merely repeated section 237(b) but has not stated how he came to the conclusion and on what material.\\nIn other words, he has not disclosed anything from which it can be said that the inference which he has drawn that the Company was being conducted with intent to defraud its creditors, members and other persons or persons concerned in the management of the affairs of the Company were guilty of fraud, misfeasance and misconduct towards the company and its members was based on circumstances present before him.\\nIn fact, paragraph 16 is no more than a mechanical repetition of the words of the section.\\nComing now to the affidavit of Mr. Dang I find that he merely repeats what was stated in the affidavit of the Chairman.\\nHe also said that he had seen the papers and agreed with his two Under Secretaries and the Regional Director that a \\\"deeper probe\\\" was necessary ' There is no hint even in this affidavit that the circumstances were such as to suggest fraud, intent to defraud or misconduct, this is to say, circumstances under which investigation can be ordered.\\nThe other affidavits also run the same way and it is not, therefore, necessary to refer to them.\\nWe are concerned really with the affidavits of the Chairman and Mr. Dang in relation to the exercise of the power conferred by section 237(b).\\nNeither proves the existence of circumstances under which the power could be exercised.\\nIn my opinion, therefore, the action has not been proved to be justified.\\nNo doubt, the section confers a discretion but it sets its own limits upon the discretion by stating clearly what must be looked for in the shape of evidence before the drastic act of investigation into the affairs of a company can be taken.\\nThe affidavits which were filed in answer to the petition do not disclose 340 even the prima facie existence of these circumstances.\\nOn the other hand, they emphasise only that there was mismanagement and losses which necessitated a \\\"deeper probe\\\".\\nIn other words, the act of the Chairman was in the nature of, a fishing expedition and not after satisfaction that the affairs of the Company were being carried on even prima facie with the intent to defraud or that the persons incharge were guilty of fraud or other misconduct.\\nAs to the constitutionality of section 237(b) I agree with my brethren Bachawat and Shelat and have nothing to add.\\n1, therefore.\\nagree with my brother Shelat that the appeal must be allowed.\\nThere will be no order about costs.\\nBachawat, J.\\nThe order dated May 19, 1965 was passed by the Chairman of the Company Law Board Mr. Setalvad submitted that only the Board could pass an order under section 237, the Central Government could delegate its function under section 237 to the Board but it had no power to authorise the Chairman to sub delegate this function to himself and consequently, the Company Law Board (Procedure) Rules, 1964 made by the Central Government on February 1, 1964 and the Chairman 's order of distribution of business dated February 6, 1964 delegating the function of the Board under section 237 to the Chairman are ultra vires the and the impugned order is invalid.\\nThe learned Attorney General disputed these submissions.\\nAs a general rule, whatever a person has power to do himself, he may do by means of an agent.\\nThis broad rule is limited by the operation of the principle that a delegated authority cannot be redelegate, delegates non protest delegate.\\nThe naming of I delegate to, do an act involving a discretion indicates that the delegate was selected because of his peculiar skill and the confidence reposed in him, and there is a presumption that he is required to do the act himself and cannot redelegate his authority.\\nAs a general rule, \\\"if the, statute directs that certain acts shall be done in a specified manner or by certain persons, their performance in any other manner than that specified or by any other person than one of those name is impliedly prohibited.\\n\\\" See Crawford on statutory Construction, 1940 Edn., article 195, p. 335: Normally, a discretion entrusted by Parliament to an administrative organ must be exercised by.\\nthat organ itself.\\nIf a statute entrusts an administrative function involving the exercise of a discretion to a Board consisting of two or more persons it is to be presumed that each member of the Board should exercise his individual judgment on the matter and all, the members of the Board should act together and arrive at a joint decision.\\nPrima facie, the Board must act as a whole and cannot delegate its function to one of its members.\\nThe learned Attorney General submitted that a distribution of business among the members of the Company Law Board is not a delegation of its authority, and the maxim has no application in 341 such a case.\\nI cannot accept this submission.\\nIn Cook vs Ward(1), the Court held that where a drainage board constituted by an Act of Parliament was authorised by it to delegate its powers to a committee, the powers so delegated to the committee must be exercised by them acting in concert and it was not competent to them to apportion those powers amongst themselves and one of them acting, alone, pursuant to such apportionment, could not justify his acts under the statute.\\nLord Coleridge, C. J. said at p. 262: \\\"It was not competent to them to delegate powers, which required the united action of the three, to be exercised according to the unaided judgment of one of them.\\\" Again, in Vine vs National Dock Labour Board(1), the House of Lords, held that a local board set up, under the scheme embodied in the schedule to the Dock Workers (Regulation of Employment) Order, 1947 had no power to assign its disciplinary function under cls.\\n15(4) and 16(2) of the scheme to a committee and the purported dismissal of a worker by the committee was a nullity.\\nIn my opinion, the distribution of the business of the Board among its members is a delegation of its authority.\\nBut the maxim \\\"delegatus non potest delegare\\\" must not be pushed too far.\\nThe maxim does not embody a rule of law.\\nIt indicates a rule of construction of a statute or other instrument conferring an authority.\\nPrima facie, a discretion conferred by a statute, on any authority is intended to be exercised by that authority, and.\\nby no other.\\nBut the intention may be negatived by any contrary indications in the language, scope or object of the statute.\\nThe construction that would best achieve the purpose and object of the statute should be adopted.\\nUnder sections 10E(1) and 637(1)(a), the Central Government has power to constitute a Company, Law Board and to delegate its functions to the Board.\\nThe Board can consist of such number of persons not exceeding five as the Government thinks fit.\\nOne of the members of the Board has to be appointed a Chairman and this necessarily implies that the Board shall consist of at least two members.\\nAs a matter of fact, the Government constituted a Board consisting of two members and appointed one of them as Chairman.\\nTo this Board the Government delegated its function under section 237.\\nSection 637 shows that the function under section 237 can be delegated to the Board and to no other authority.\\nThe function under section 237(b) involves the exercise of a discretion.\\nPrima facie, all the members of the Board acting together were required to discharge this function and they could not delegate their duty to the Chairman.\\nHowever, under sections 10E(5) and 642(1), the Central Government may frame rules regulating the procedure of the Board and generally to carry out the purposes of the Act.\\nIn the context of section 10E, I am inclined to construe this rule making power liberally The Central Government has power to constitute the Company Law Board, to delegate its functions to the Board and to control (1) (2) 342 the Board in the exercise of its delegated functions.\\nIn this background, by conferring on the Central Government the additional power of framing rules regulating the procedure of the Board and generally to carry out the purposes of section 10E, the Parliament must have intended that the internal Organisation of the Board and the mode and manner of transacting its business should be regulated entirely by rules framed by the Government.\\nThe Government had, therefore, power to frame the Company Law Board (Procedure) Rules, 1964 authorising the Chairman to distribute the business of the Board.\\nIn the exercise of the power conferred by this rule, the Chairman assigned the business under section 237 to himself.\\nThe Chairman alone could, therefore, pass the impugned order.\\nAct No. 31 of 1965 has now inserted sub section\\n(4A) in section 10E authorising the Board to delegate its powers and functions to its Chairman or other members or principal officer.\\nThe power under sub section\\n(4A) may be exercised by the Board independently of any rules framed by the Central Government.\\nWe find, however, that the Central Government had under sections 10E(5) and 642(1) ample power to frame rules authorising the Chairman to distribute the business of the Board.\\nThe wide ambit of this rule making power is not cut down by the subsequent insertion of sub section\\n(4A) in section 10E. Sections 235, 237(a) and 237(b) enable the Central Govern ment to make an order appointing an inspector to investigate the affairs of a company in different sets of circumstances, and the contention that section 237(b) is discriminatory and is violative of article 14 must fail.\\nI also think that section 237(b) is not violative of articles 19(1)(f) and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution.\\nThe company is not a citizen and has no fundamental right under article 19.\\nAppellant No. 2 who is the managing director of the company is not a citizen, but even assuming that section 237(b) imposes restrictions on his right of property or his right to carry on his occupation as managing director, those restrictions are reasonable and are imposed in the interests of the general public.\\nOn the question of mala fides, I am inclined to think that the Chairman passed the order dated May 19, 1965 independently of and without any pressure from the Minister.\\nI am all the more persuaded to come to this conclusion having regard to the fact that in paragraph 14 of his affidavit the Chairman has disclosed the circumstances which he took into account in passing the order.\\nIn paragraphs 5, 8 and 16 of his affidavit, the Chairman stated that he had various materials on the basis of which he passed the order.\\nBut, on reading this affidavit as a whole and the affidavit of Mr. Dang, I am satisfied that in paragraph 14 of his affidavit the Chairman has set out all the material circumstances which bad emerged on an examination of the various materials before him.\\nBriefly put, those circumstances are delay, bungling and faulty planning by the management resulting in double expenditure, huge losses, sharp fall in the price of the Company 's shares and the resignation of some of the directors on account of differences in opinion with 343 the managing director.\\nI think that these circumstances, without more, cannot reasonably suggest that the business of the company was being conducted to defraud the creditors, members and other persons or that the management was guilty of fraud towards the company and its members.\\nNo reasonable person who had given proper consideration to these circumstances could have formed the opinion that they suggested any fraud as mentioned in the order dated May 19, 1965.\\nHad the Chairman applied his mind to the relevant facts, he could not have formed this opinion.\\nI am, there fore, inclined to think that he formed the opinion without applying his mind to the facts.\\nAn opinion so formed by him is in excess of his powers and cannot support an order under section 237(b).\\nThe appeal is allowed, and the impugned order is set aside.\\nI concur in the order which Shelat, J. proposes to pass.\\nShelat J.\\nThe appellant company is a public limited company registered on July 28, 1961 having its registered office at Ramavaram in Andhra Pradesh and the second appellant was at all material times and is still its managing director.\\nOn August 25, 1959 and September 23, 1960 appellant No. 2 obtained two licences for the manufacture of 2500 and 1900 tonnes of barium chemicals per year in the name of Transworld Traders of which lie was the proprietor.\\nHe then started negotiations with Kali Cliemle of Hannover, West Germany to collaborate with him in setting up a plant.\\nWhile he was so negotiating, M/s., ,T. T. Krishnamachari & Co., who were the sole selling agents of the said German Company, approached the 2nd appellant for the sole selling agency of barium products of the plant proposed to be put up by the 2nd appellant.\\nThe 2nd appellant did not agree.\\nOn December 5, 1960 M/s. T. T. K. & Co., applied for a licence for manufacture of barium chemicals.\\nOn December 23, 1960 the 2nd appellant wrote a letter to the Minister of Commerce and Industry objecting to the grant of a licence to M/s. T. T. K. & Co. Both were considered by the Licensing Committee.\\nThe Committee rejected the application of M/s. T. T. K. & Co., but advised them to apply again after six months.\\nOn a representation by M / section T. T. K. &.Co., the Committee reconsidered the matter and recommended the grant of licence to M/s. T. T. K. Chemicals Private Limited.\\nThe second appellant once more protested, this time to the Prime Minister but that was rejected.\\nOn July 28, 1961.\\nan agreement between the appellant company and L.A. Mitchell Ltd., of Manchester was signed where under the latter agreed to put up the plant on the appellant company agreeing to pay them pound 184,500.\\nOn November 27, 1961, the Government granted a licence to the company for the import of machinery.\\n, In the mean time, respondent No. 2 was appointed a, Minister without portfolio and rejoined the Cabinet which lie had left ' earlier owing to certain circumstances which are not relevant for the present.\\nFrom January, 1962 to March, 1963, he continued as a L/S5SCI 24 344 Minister without portfolio but from March, 1963 to September, 1963, he became the Minister for Defence and Economic Co ordination and thereafter the Finance Minister.\\nOn August 30, 1962, the licence granted to M / section T. T. K. Chemicals Ltd. was revoked as the company had decided to surrender it.\\nIt would seem that the appellant company was not faring as well as was hoped and though it had been incorporated as early as July, 1961 production had not commenced.\\nThere arose also disputes among its directors.\\nOn May 30, 1964 and July 9, 1964 four of its directors submitted two memoranda alleging irregularities and even illegalities in the conduct of the company 's affairs to the Company Law Board.\\nAccording to the second appellant, the four directors were disgruntled directors, hostile to him and the Company.\\nThe company was not able to start work in full capacity not because of any irregularities but because of the faulty planning and designing by the collaborators.\\nThe company realised this fact only in June, 1964 when it received a survey report after the breakdown of the plant during that month from M/s. Humphreys and Glascow (Overseas) Ltd., Bombay.\\nIn September, 1964, a meeting was affanged in London between the company 's representatives and the representatives of L.A. Mitchell Ltd., of which Lord Poole was the Chairman.\\nIt was agreed that L. A. Mitchell Ltd., should depute M/s. Humphreys and Glascow Ltd., London,to go through the designs etc., and to make a report showing the causes of the repeated failures of the plant and suggesting remedies there for.\\nLord Poole also agreed that the factory would be commissioned without any further delay and that L.A. Mitchell Ltd., would carry out the necessary repairs at their cost.\\nWhile these negotiations were going on, representatives of M/s. Kali Chemie of Hannover arrived in India to negotiate a collaboration agreement with the company.\\nOn April 4, 1965, a meeting of the company 's directors was held in New Delhi which was attended by one Kriegstein, a representative of Kali Chemie and also by the General Manager of M/s. T. T. K. & Co. Certain proposals were discussed and it was decided that the company should give notice to L. A. Mitchell Ltd. canceling the agreement with them.\\nAccordingly, by a notice dated April 2. 1965 the agreement with the said L. A. Mitchell Ltd., was cancelled.\\nOn May 7, 1965 representatives of the appellant company and of Kali Chemie met at Stuttgart when proposals for an agreement were discussed.\\nOne of these proposals was that the company should be reorganised and its share capital should be distributed in the following proportions: 49 per cent to the appellant company, 26 per cent to Kali Chemie and 25 per cent to M/s. T. T. K. & Co. It was also proposed that Kali Chemie should take over the responsibility on the production side, the appellant company would be responsible for the management and M/s. T.T.K. & Co. should take over sales promotion.\\nBefore however these negotiations could take concrete shape, Lord Poole came over to India.\\nA meet ing was held on May 10, 1965 between him and the directors of the 345 appellant company.\\nLord Poole agreed that the British company would put in pound 250,000 in addition to the amount already invested by it and that production would commence from June, 1965.\\nOn May It 1965 another meeting took place when it was decided that without prejudice to what was stated in the notice of April 4, 1965, the appellant company should withdraw para 9 thereof whereby the agreement between them was terminated.\\nBy May 11, 1965, the position therefore was that the collaboration agreement between the company and L. A. Mitchell Ltd. was agreed to be continued and consequently the negotiations with the German company and M/s. T. T. K. & Co., were not to proceed further.\\nOn May 19 1965 the first respondent passed the impugned order which inter alia stated: \\\"In the opinion of the Company Law Board there are circumstances suggesting that the business of M/s Barium Chemicals Ltd is being conducted with intent to defraud its creditors, members and other persons; and further that the persons concerned in the management of the affairs of the company have in connection therewith been guilty of fraud, misfeasance and other misconduct towards the company and its members.\\n\",\n          \"This appeal raises a short question of construction of shipbuilders refund guarantees given pursuant to six shipbuilding contracts (the Contracts).\\nThe Contracts, which were all dated 11 May 2007, were between each of the first to sixth claimants (the Buyers) and Jinse Shipbuilding Co Ltd (the Builder).\\nUnder the Contracts the Builder agreed to build and sell one vessel to each of the Buyers.\\nThe price of each vessel was US$33,300,000, payable in five equal instalments of US$6,660,000 due at specified points of time, with the final instalment payable on delivery.1 By Article X.8 of the Contracts it was a condition precedent to payment by the Buyers of the first instalment that the Builder would deliver to the Buyers refund guarantees relating to the first and subsequent instalments in a form acceptable to the Buyers financiers.\\nAs envisaged by Article X.8, by letter dated 22 August 2007 the respondent, Kookmin Bank (the Bank), issued six materially identical Advance Payment Bonds (the Bonds), one to each of the Buyers.\\nThe seventh claimant (the Assignee) is the assignee of the benefit of the Bonds.\\nOn 29 August 2007, the Buyers each paid the first instalment of US$6,660,000 due under the Contracts.\\nOn 29 September 2007, the first claimant paid the second instalment of US$6,660,000 under the contract to which it is a party.\\nIn 2008 the Builder experienced financial difficulties and in late January 2009 it entered into and/or became subject to a debt workout procedure under the Korean Corporate Restructuring Promotion Law 2007.\\nOn 25 February 2009 the Buyers wrote to the Builder notifying it that this development triggered Article XII.3 of the Contracts and demanding an immediate refund of all the instalments paid, together with interest at 7% per annum.\\nThe Builder refused to make any refund on the ground that Article XII.3 of the Contracts had not been triggered as alleged.\\nThe dispute between the Buyers and the Builder has been submitted to arbitration pursuant to Article XIV.3 of the Contracts. 1 There was subsequently a small reduction in the overall price and a corresponding reduction in the final instalment for each vessel but that is immaterial to the issues in the appeal.\\nOn 23 April 2009, the Buyers wrote to the Bank demanding repayment under the Bonds of the instalments paid under the Contracts.\\nThe Bank refused to pay.\\nIt did so initially on the ground that it was not obliged to pay pending resolution of the dispute between the Buyers and the Builder.\\nThat argument was subsequently rejected by Simon J (the Judge) and there was no appeal to the Court of Appeal against that part of his order: [2009] EWHC Civ 2624 (Comm).\\nThe Bank subsequently raised a separate, and logically prior, argument that, on their true construction, the Bonds did not cover refunds to which the Buyers were entitled pursuant to Article XII.3 of the Contracts.\\nThat argument was also rejected by the Judge, who gave summary judgment for the Assignee, but succeeded in the Court of Appeal, which gave summary judgment for the Bank against the Buyers and the Assignee.\\nIn the Court of Appeal Sir Simon Tuckey agreed with the Judge but the majority, comprising Thorpe and Patten LJJ, held the Banks argument to be correct: [2010] EWCA Civ 582.\\nThe orders of the Judge and the Court of Appeal were made on 29 October 2009 and 27 May 2010 respectively.\\nThe Court of Appeal refused permission to appeal.\\nThe Buyers appeal to this Court pursuant to permission granted by the Court.\\nThe issue is whether, on the true construction of paragraph 3 of the Bonds, the Buyers are entitled to payment under the Bonds in respect of refunds to which they are entitled under Article XII.3 of the Contracts.\\nNo one suggested that the successful parties should not have summary judgment in their favour.\\nThe Bonds\\nI begin with the Bonds because it was common ground that all depends upon the true construction of the Bonds and that the terms and meaning of the Contracts are only relevant to the extent that they inform the true construction of the Bonds.\\nThe paragraphs in the letter comprising the Bonds were not numbered but both the Judge and the Court of Appeal referred to them by number for convenience of reference and I will do the same.\\nAs so numbered the relevant parts of each Bond were these: [1] We refer to the Contract entered into between the Builder and yourselves for the construction and delivery of the Vessel to be delivered before [31 July 2009].\\nOther terms and expressions used in this Bond shall have the same meaning as in the Contract, a copy of which has been provided to us. [2] Pursuant to the terms of the Contract, you are entitled, upon your rejection of the Vessel in accordance with the terms of the Contract, your termination, cancellation or rescission of the Contract or upon a Total Loss of the Vessel, to repayment of the pre delivery instalments of the Contract Price paid by you prior to such termination or a Total Loss of the Vessel (as the case may be) and the value of the Buyer's Supplies delivered to the Shipyard (if any) together with interest thereon at the rate of . (7%) per annum (or . (10%) per annum in the case of a Total Loss of the Vessel) from the respective dates of payment by you of such instalments to the date of remittance by telegraphic transfer of such refund. [3] In consideration of your agreement to make the pre delivery instalments under the Contract and for other good and valuable consideration (the receipt and adequacy of which is hereby acknowledged), we hereby, as primary obligor, irrevocably and unconditionally undertake to pay to you, your successors and assigns, on your first written demand, all such sums due to you under the Contract (or such sums which would have been due to you but for any irregularity, illegality, invalidity or unenforceability in whole or in part of the Contract) PROVIDED THAT the total amount recoverable by you under this Bond shall not exceed US $[26,640,000] . plus interest thereon at the rate of . (7%) per annum (or . (10%) per annum in the case of a Total Loss of the Vessel) from the respective dates of payment by you of such instalments to the date of remittance by telegraphic transfer of such refund. [4] Payment by us under this Bond shall be made without any deduction or withholding, and promptly on receipt by us of a written demand (substantially in the form attached) signed by two of your directors stating that the Builder has failed to fulfil the terms and conditions of the Contract and as a result of such failure, the amount claimed is due to you and specifying in what respects the Builder has so failed and the amount claimed.\\nSuch claim and statement shall be accepted by us as evidence for the purposes of this Bond alone that this amount claimed is due to you under this Bond. [5] Our liability under this Bond shall not be affected by (v) any insolvency, re organisation or dissolution of the Builder, or (vi) any other matter or thing which may operate to discharge or reduce our liability hereunder.\\nThe Bonds further provided that they were assignable, that they were governed by English law and that all disputes arising out of them were to be determined by the Commercial Court.\\nThe resolution of the issue between the parties depends upon the true construction of paragraph [3].\\nThe Bank promised to pay on demand all such sums due to you under the Contract.\\nThe question is what was meant by such sums.\\nOnly two possibilities were suggested.\\nThe Buyers said (and the Judge and Sir Simon Tuckey held) that the expression such sums referred back to the pre delivery instalments in the first line.\\nThey said that the purpose of the Bond was to guarantee the refund of pre delivery instalments and that the promise was therefore to refund pre delivery instalments.\\nBy contrast the Bank said (and Thorpe and Patten LJJ held) that the expression such sums was a reference back to the sums referred to in paragraph [2], namely the repayment of the pre delivery instalments paid prior to a termination of the Contract or a Total Loss of the vessel and the value of the Buyers Supplies in the case of a Total Loss.\\nOn the Buyers analysis the Bond guaranteed pre delivery instalments which were repayable under Article XII.3 in the case of any insolvency event, whereas on the Banks analysis it did not.\\nThe Contracts\\nIt is common ground that the terms of the Contracts are relevant to the true construction of the Bonds.\\nThey are referred to in the Bonds and provide the immediate context in which the Bonds were entered into.\\nThey are thus plainly an important aid to the meaning of the Bonds.\\nArticle X of the Contracts provided, so far as material as follows: ARTICLE X: PAYMENT 5.\\nREFUND BY THE BUILDER The payments made by the Buyer to the Builder prior to delivery of the Vessel shall constitute advances to the Builder.\\nIf the Vessel is rejected by the Buyer in accordance with the terms of this Contract, or if the Buyer terminates, cancels or rescinds this Contract pursuant to any of the provisions of this Contract specifically permitting the Buyer to do so, the Builder shall forthwith refund to the Buyer in US dollars, the full amount of total sums paid by the Buyer to the Builder in advance of delivery together with interest thereon as herein provided within thirty (30) banking days of acceptance of rejection.\\nThe interest rate of the refund shall be seven per cent (7%) per annum If the Builder is required to refund to the Buyer the installments paid by the Buyer to the Builder as provided in this Paragraph, the Builder shall return to the Buyer all of the Buyer's Supplies as stipulated in Article XIII which were not incorporated into the Vessel and pay to the Buyer an amount equal to the cost to the Buyer of those Buyer's Supplies incorporated into the Vessel. 6.\\nTOTAL LOSS If there is a total loss or a constructive total loss of the Vessel prior to delivery thereof, the Builder shall proceed according to the mutual agreement of the parties hereto either: (a) to build another vessel in place of the Vessel so lost . provided that the parties hereto shall have agreed in writing to a reasonable cost and time for the construction or (b) to refund to the Buyer the full amount of the total sums paid by the Buyer to the Builder under the provisions of Paragraph 2 of this Article and the value of Buyer's Supplies delivered to the Shipyard, if any, together with interest thereon at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum .\\nIf the parties hereto fail to reach such agreement within two (2) months after the Vessel is determined to be a total loss or constructive total loss, the provisions of (b) hereinabove shall be applied. 8.\\nThe Builder shall as a condition precedent to payment by the Buyer of the first installment deliver to the Buyer an assignable letter of guarantee issued by a first class Korean Bank . to Buyer's Financiers for the refund of the first installment, and at the same time, together with the letter of guarantee relating to the first installment, Builder shall also deliver to the Buyer an assignable letter of guarantee issued by a first class Korean Bank . for the refund of the respective installments following the way of the payment stipulated in this Article.\\nThe refund guarantees by the Builder to the Buyer shall be indicated pre delivery installments plus interest as aforesaid to the Buyer under or pursuant to paragraph 5 above in the form annexed hereto as Exhibit A which is yet to be agreed In the event that the Refund Guarantees, for all installments, have not been provided to the Buyer in a form acceptable to the Buyers financiers and have not been issued by an entity acceptable to REFUND GUARANTEE Buyers financiers, by the 31st of August 2007 then the Buyer may cancel this Contract without penalty on either side.\\nIt is common ground that no form of guarantee was in fact annexed to the Contracts.\\nArticle XII provided, so far as relevant: ARTICLE XII: BUILDERS DEFAULT 3.\\nIf the Builder shall apply for or consent to the appointment of a receiver, trustee or liquidator, shall be adjudicated insolvent, shall apply to the courts for protection from its creditors, file a voluntary petition in bankruptcy or take advantage of any insolvency law, or any action shall be taken by the Builder having an effect similar to any of the foregoing or the equivalent thereof in any jurisdiction, the Buyer may by notice in writing to the Builder require the Builder to refund immediately to the Buyer the full amount of all sums paid by the Buyer to the Builder on account of the Vessel and interest thereon at seven percent (7%) per annum on the amount to be refunded to the Buyer, computed from the respective date such sums were paid by the Buyer to the date of remittance of the refundable amount to the Buyer and immediately upon receipt of such notice the Builder shall refund such amount to the Buyer.\\nFollowing such refund the Builder may, but shall not be obliged to, by notice in writing to the Buyer given within ten (10) business days terminate this contract.\\nIf the Builder does not so terminate the Contract the Buyer's obligation to pay further installments prior to delivery of the Vessel under Article X 2(a),(b),(c) and (d) shall be suspended and the full Contract price shall be paid to the Builder upon delivery of the Vessel in the manner contemplated by Article X paragraph 2(e).\\nThe Contracts contained a number of provisions which entitled the Buyer to cancel the contract, namely Articles III.1 and XII.1 (delay) and Article III.2(b), 3(c), 4(d) and 5(d) (insufficient speed, excessive fuel consumption, deficient deadweight or cargo capacity).\\nSome of those provisions specifically entitled the Buyer to a refund of all advance payments following cancellation.\\nOthers did not, although in such cases Article X.5 would apply and have the same effect.\\nThe Contracts also contained in Article XIII further detailed provisions relating to Buyers Supplies.\\nThe correct approach to construction\\nFor the most part, the correct approach to construction of the Bonds, as in the case of any contract, was not in dispute.\\nThe principles have been discussed in many cases, notably of course, as Lord Neuberger MR said in Pink Floyd Music Ltd v EMI Records Ltd [2010] EWCA Civ 1429; [2011] 1 WLR 770 at para 17, by Lord Hoffmann in Mannai Investment Co Ltd v Eagle Star Life Assurance Co Ltd [1997] AC 749, passim, in Investors Compensation Scheme Ltd v West Bromwich Building Society [1998] 1 WLR 896, 912F 913G and in Chartbrook Ltd v Persimmon Homes Ltd [2009] 1 AC 1101, paras 21 26.\\nI agree with Lord Neuberger (also at para 17) that those cases show that the ultimate aim of interpreting a provision in a contract, especially a commercial contract, is to determine what the parties meant by the language used, which involves ascertaining what a reasonable person would have understood the parties to have meant.\\nAs Lord Hoffmann made clear in the first of the principles he summarised in the Investors Compensation Scheme case at page 912H, the relevant reasonable person is one who has all the background knowledge which would reasonably have been available to the parties in the situation in which they were at the time of the contract.\\nThe issue between the parties in this appeal is the role to be played by considerations of business common sense in determining what the parties meant.\\nSir Simon Tuckey said at para 19 of his judgment that there was no dispute about the principles of construction and the Bank so submitted in its skeleton argument.\\nHowever, I do not think that is quite correct.\\nAt para 18 Sir Simon identified the question of construction substantially as set out in para 9 above and said at para 19: There is no dispute about the principles of construction to be applied in order to answer this question.\\nThe court must first look at the words which the parties have used in the bond itself.\\nThe shipbuilding contract is of course the context and cause for the bond but is nevertheless a separate contract between different parties.\\nIf the language of the bond leads clearly to a conclusion that one or other of the constructions contended for is the correct one, the Court must give effect to it, however surprising or unreasonable the result might be.\\nBut if there are two possible constructions, the Court is entitled to reject the one which is unreasonable and, in a commercial context, the one which flouts business common sense.\\nThis follows from the House of Lords decisions in Wickman Machine Tools Sales Limited v Schuler AG [1974] AC 235, where at 251 Lord Reid said: The fact that a particular construction leads to a very unreasonable result must be a relevant consideration.\\nThe more unreasonable the result, the more unlikely it is that the parties can have intended it, and if they do intend it the more necessary it is that they shall make that intention abundantly clear. and The Antaios [1984] AC 191, where at 201 Lord Diplock said: If detailed and syntactical analysis of words in a commercial contract is going to lead to a conclusion that flouts business common sense it must yield to business common sense.\\nAs I read his judgment, Patten LJ did not put the question in quite the same way.\\nThis can be seen from paras 35 to 44 of his judgment.\\nAt para 35 he referred to Sir Simon Tuckeys approach at para 19 (as quoted above).\\nHe also referred to para 18(iii) of the Judges judgment, where the Judge described the Banks construction of the Bond as having the surprising and uncommercial result of the guarantee not being available to meet the Builders repayment obligations in the event of insolvency.\\nPatten LJ noted that the Judge appeared to have taken that into account as a factor in favour of the Buyers construction of paragraph [3] of the Bonds.\\nPatten LJ added that the Judges approach was the same as that of Sir Simon Tuckey.\\nPatten LJ then referred to the cases mentioned above and expressed his conclusion in principle thus at para 42: In this case (as in most others) the Court is not privy to the negotiations between the parties or to the commercial and other pressures which may have dictated the balance of interests which the contract strikes.\\nUnless the most natural meaning of the words produces a result which is so extreme as to suggest that it was unintended, the Court has no alternative but to give effect it its terms.\\nTo do otherwise would be to risk imposing obligations on one or other party which they were never willing to assume and in circumstances which amount to no more than guesswork on the part of the Court.\\nFinally, at paras 43 and 44, Patten LJ quoted from the speeches of Lord Wilberforce in Prenn v Simmonds [1971] 1 WLR 1381, 1384 5 and of Lord Hoffmann in Chartbrook at para 20, where they discussed the reason for the rule excluding evidence of pre contractual negotiations.\\nIn particular they stressed the irrelevance of the parties subjective intentions and noted that the mere fact that a term in the contract appears to be particularly unfavourable to one party or the other is irrelevant.\\nAs Lord Hoffmann put it, the term may have been agreed in exchange for some concession made elsewhere in the transaction or it may simply have been a bad bargain.\\nI entirely accept those caveats.\\nHowever, it seems to me to be clear that the principle stated by Patten LJ in para 42 is different from that stated by the Judge in his para 18(iii) and by Sir Simon Tuckey in para 19.\\nIt is not in my judgment necessary to conclude that, unless the most natural meaning of the words produces a result so extreme as to suggest that it was unintended, the court must give effect to that meaning.\\nThe language used by the parties will often have more than one potential meaning.\\nI would accept the submission made on behalf of the appellants that the exercise of construction is essentially one unitary exercise in which the court must consider the language used and ascertain what a reasonable person, that is a person who has all the background knowledge which would reasonably have been available to the parties in the situation in which they were at the time of the contract, would have understood the parties to have meant.\\nIn doing so, the court must have regard to all the relevant surrounding circumstances.\\nIf there are two possible constructions, the court is entitled to prefer the construction which is consistent with business common sense and to reject the other.\\nThis conclusion appears to me to be supported by Lord Reids approach in Wickman quoted by Sir Simon Tuckey and set out above.\\nI am of course aware that, in considering statements of general principle in a particular case, the court must have regard to the fact that the precise formulation of the proposition may be affected by the facts of the case.\\nNevertheless, there is a consistent body of opinion, largely collated by the Buyers in an appendix to their case, which supports the approach of the Judge and Sir Simon Tuckey.\\nWhere the parties have used unambiguous language, the court must apply it.\\nThis can be seen from the decision of the Court of Appeal in Co operative Wholesale Society Ltd vs National Westminster Bank plc [1995] 1 EGLR 97.\\nThe court was considering the true construction of rent review clauses in a number of different cases.\\nThe underlying result which the landlords sought in each case was the same.\\nThe court regarded it as a most improbable commercial result.\\nWhere the result, though improbable, flowed from the unambiguous language of the clause, the landlords succeeded, whereas where it did not, they failed.\\nThe court held that ordinary principles of construction applied to rent review clauses and applied the principles in The Antaios (Antaios Compania Naviera SA v Salen Rederierna AB) [1985] AC 191.\\nAfter quoting the passage from the speech of Lord Diplock cited above, Hoffmann LJ said, at p 98: This robust declaration does not, however, mean that one can rewrite the language which the parties have used in order to make the contract conform to business common sense.\\nBut language is a very flexible instrument and, if it is capable of more than one construction, one chooses that which seems most likely to give effect to the commercial purpose of the agreement.\\nThe court also comprised Leggatt and Simon Brown LJJ.\\nSimon Brown LJ at p 101 said that, having regard to the improbable result for which the landlords contended, only the most unambiguous of such clauses could properly be found to bear the landlords construction and that in the case of only one of the leases did the clause unambiguously achieve the improbable result for which the landlords contend.\\nThe case is of interest because Simon Brown LJ considered that, of the other three cases, one unambiguously failed to achieve the result sought by the landlords, whereas, of the other two, he said this at p 102: For my part, I would accept that the more obvious reading of both favours the landlords construction.\\nI am persuaded, however, that they are capable of being, and therefore, for the reasons already given, should be, construed differently.\\nThat case is therefore an example of the adoption and application of the principle endorsed by the Judge and by Sir Simon Tuckey.\\nSee also International Fina Services AG v Katrina Shipping Ltd, The Fina Samco [1995] 2 Lloyd's Rep. 344, where Neill LJ said at page 350 it was necessary when construing a commercial document to strive to attribute to it a meaning which accords with business common sense.\\nIn 1997, writing extra judicially (Contract Law: Fulfilling the reasonable expectations of honest men) in 113 LQR 433, 441 Lord Steyn expressed the principle thus: Often there is no obvious or ordinary meaning of the language under consideration.\\nThere are competing interpretations to be considered.\\nIn choosing between alternatives a court should primarily be guided by the contextual scene in which the stipulation in question appears.\\nAnd speaking generally commercially minded judges would regard the commercial purpose of the contract as more important than niceties of language.\\nAnd, in the event of doubt, the working assumption will be that a fair construction best matches the reasonable expectations of the parties.\\nI agree.\\nHe said much the same judicially in Society of Lloyds v Robinson [1999] 1 All ER (Comm) 545, 551: Loyalty to the text of a commercial contract, instrument, or document read in its contextual setting is the paramount principle of interpretation.\\nBut in the process of interpreting the meaning of the language of a commercial document the court ought generally to favour a commercially sensible construction.\\nThe reason for this approach is that a commercial construction is likely to give effect to the intention of the parties.\\nWords ought therefore to be interpreted in the way in which a reasonable commercial person would construe them.\\nAnd the reasonable commercial person can safely be assumed to be unimpressed with technical interpretations and undue emphasis on niceties of language.\\nSimilar assistance is at hand nearer at home.\\nIn Gan Insurance Co Ltd v Tai Ping Insurance Co Ltd [2001] CLC 1103, 1118 1119; [2011] EWCA Civ 1047; [2001] 2 All ER (Comm) 299, Mance LJ said: 13.\\nConstruction, as Sir Thomas Bingham MR said in Arbuthnott v Fagan [1995] CLC 1396 at p 1400 is thus a composite exercise, neither uncompromisingly literal nor unswervingly purposive.\\nTo para (5), one may add as a coda words of Lord Bridge in Mitsui Construction Co Ltd v A G of Hong Kong (1986) 33 BLR 14, cited in my judgment in Sinochem International Oil (London) Ltd v Mobil Sales and Supply Corp [2000] CLC 878 at p 885.\\nSpeaking of a poorly drafted and ambiguous contract, Lord Bridge said that poor drafting itself provides: no reason to depart from the fundamental rule of construction of contractual documents that the intention of the parties must be ascertained from the language that they have used interpreted in the light of the relevant factual situation in which the contract was made.\\nBut the poorer the quality of the drafting, the less willing the court should be to be driven by semantic niceties to attribute to the parties an improbable and unbusinesslike intention, if the language used, whatever it may lack in precision, is reasonably capable of an interpretation which attributes to the parties an intention to make provision for contingencies inherent in the work contracted for on a sensible and businesslike basis. 16 . in my judgment the subclause has no very natural meaning and is, at the least, open to two possible meanings or interpretations one the judge's, the other that it addresses two separate subject matters.\\nIn these circumstances, it is especially important to undertake the exercise on which the judge declined to embark, that is to consider the implications of each interpretation.\\nIn my opinion, a court when construing any document should always have an eye to the consequences of a particular construction, even if they often only serve as a check on an obvious meaning or a restraint upon adoption of a conceivable but unbusinesslike meaning.\\nIn intermediate situations, as Professor Guest wisely observes in Chitty on Contracts (28th edn) vol 1, para. 12 049, a balance has to be struck through the exercise of sound judicial discretion.\\nMore generally, in Homburg Houtimport BV v Agrosin Private Ltd: The Starsin [2004] 1 AC 715, para 10 Lord Bingham referred to the rule to which Lord Halsbury LC alluded in Glynn v Margetson & Co [1893] AC 351, 359, that a business sense will be given to business documents.\\nThe business sense is that which businessmen, in the course of their ordinary dealings, would give the document.\\nThree other cases merit brief reference.\\nThe same approach was adopted by Arden LJ in In the Matter of Golden Key Ltd (In Receivership) [2009] EWCA Civ 636, paras 29 and 42 and by this Court in In Re Sigma Finance Corporation (in administrative receivership) [2009] UKSC 2; [2010] 1 All ER 571, where Lord Mance said at para 12 that the resolution of an issue of interpretation in a case like the present was an iterative process, involving checking each of the rival meanings against other provisions of the document and investigating its commercial consequences.\\nFinally, it is worth setting out two extracts from the judgment of Longmore LJ in Barclays Bank plc v HHY Luxembourg SARL [2010] EWCA Civ 1248; [2011] 1 BCLC 336, paras 25 and 26: 25.\\nThe matter does not of course rest there because when alternative constructions are available one has to consider which is the more commercially sensible.\\nOn this aspect of the matter Mr Zacaroli has all the cards. 26.\\nThe judge said that it did not flout common sense to say that the clause provided for a very limited level of release, but that, with respect, is not quite the way to look at the matter.\\nIf a clause is capable of two meanings, as on any view this clause is, it is quite possible that neither meaning will flout common sense.\\nIn such circumstances, it is much more appropriate to adopt the more, rather than the less, commercial construction.\\nIn my opinion Longmore LJ has there neatly summarised the correct approach to the problem.\\nThat approach is now supported by a significant body of authority.\\nAs stated in a little more detail in para 21 above, it is in essence that, where a term of a contract is open to more than one interpretation, it is generally appropriate to adopt the interpretation which is most consistent with business common sense.\\nFor these reasons I prefer the approach of the Judge and Sir Simon Tuckey to that of Patten LJ, which is to my mind significantly different on this point.\\nApplication to the facts\\nAs indicated above, two possible interpretations of paragraph [3] of the Bonds were advanced.\\nIt was conceded on behalf of the Bank in the Court of Appeal that both constructions were arguable.\\nI did not understand Mr Guy Philipps QC to resile from that position on behalf of the Bank in this Court.\\nIn any event, in my judgment there are indeed two possible interpretations.\\nThe strength of the Banks interpretation is that it is not easy to see the point of paragraph [2] of the Bonds if the Buyers interpretation of paragraph [3] is correct.\\nOn the other hand, the Buyers interpretation is straightforward.\\nIt is that, reduced to its essentials, the Banks promise in paragraph [3] was that in consideration of your [ie the Buyers] agreement to make the pre delivery instalments we hereby, as primary obligor, promise to pay to you, your successors and assigns, on your first written demand, all such sums due to you under the Contract .\\nIn the absence of paragraph [2] there could be no doubt that the reference to such sums was a reference to the pre delivery instalments at the beginning of paragraph [3].\\nThat makes perfect sense because one would naturally expect the parties to agree (and the Buyers financiers to insist) that, in the event, for example, of the insolvency of the Builders, the Buyers should have security for the repayment of the pre delivery instalments which they had paid.\\nThe question is whether the presence of paragraph [2] leads to a different conclusion.\\nIt was submitted with force by Mr Philipps on behalf of the Bank that it did.\\nHe correctly submitted that paragraph [3] must be construed in its context and that part of the context was paragraph [2], which was of course the immediately preceding paragraph.\\nHe submitted that the only purpose there can have been for including paragraph [2] in the Bonds was to identify the scope of paragraph [3].\\nHe further submitted that no other sensible explanation for the inclusion of paragraph [2] had been advanced on behalf of the Buyers.\\nI accept the submission that no very good reason was advanced on behalf of the Buyers for the inclusion of paragraph [2] in the Bonds.\\nThe best they could do was to say that it was a preamble to the operative provision in paragraph [3], that it simply set out some of the Buyers rights under the Contracts and that it was not intended to identify the scope of the Banks liability under the Bonds.\\nPatten LJ accepted at para 50 that the Buyers construction was arguable but said that, in his view, it was not the meaning that the document would convey to a reasonable person reading it with knowledge of the terms of the Contracts.\\nThis must I think mean that he took the view that, although it was arguable that it had that effect, it did not in fact do so.\\nOtherwise the Buyers construction could not in any relevant sense have been said to be arguable and Patten LJ would surely not have described it as such.\\nPatten LJ made this clear in para 51 (quoted below), where he described the alternative constructions as not being in any way evenly balanced.\\nThe position is thus that, although he regarded both constructions as arguable in the sense that the Bonds might convey either construction to a reasonable person reading the Bonds with knowledge of the terms of the Contracts, in his view the Banks construction was plainly to be preferred.\\nIf Patten LJ went further later in para 51, where he said that the fact that cover for the insolvency of the Builder was desirable did not justify a departure from what would otherwise be the natural and obvious construction of the bond, I respectfully disagree because I do not regard the Banks construction as being the natural and ordinary meaning of the Bonds.\\nI have considered the competing arguments for myself and have concluded that they are much more finely balanced than suggested by Patten LJ and the Bank.\\nIn para 48 Patten LJ expressed the view that paragraph [2] of the Bonds reproduced the terms of Article X.5 and Article X.6 of the Contracts and therefore complied with Article X.8.\\nIn para 49 he concluded that the obvious purpose of paragraph [2] was to give the addressee of the Bonds a clear statement of the Builders obligations under the Contracts which are to be covered by the guarantee and one which is consistent with the terms of the Builders obligations to provide the bond under Article X.8 of the contract.\\nFor my part, I would not entirely accept that analysis.\\nParagraph [2] of the Bonds did reproduce the terms of Article X.5 and Article X.6 of the Contracts but it does not seem to me that it complied with the requirements of Article X.8.\\nAs I see it, Article X.8 did not provide for the terms in which the Bonds were to be issued.\\nIt provided that two letters of guarantee were to be provided, the first by a first class Korean Bank or Guarantee Insurance Company for the refund of the first instalment and the second issued by a first class Korean Bank or Guarantee Insurance Company acceptable to the Buyers financiers for the refund of the respective installments following the way of the payment stipulated in this Article.\\nThe first paragraph of Article X.8 included this: The refund guarantees by the Builder to the Buyer shall be indicated pre delivery instalments plus interest as aforesaid to the Buyer under or pursuant to paragraph 5 above in the form annexed hereto as Exhibit A which is yet to be agreed.\\nIn fact there was no form annexed to the Contracts, so it is far from clear what was meant by the sentence of the first paragraph of Article X.8 just quoted.\\nAs I see it, it was left that the parties would agree the final form of the Bonds referable to the second and subsequent instalments.\\nMoreover both the identity of the issuer of the Bonds and the form of the Bonds were to be acceptable to the Buyers financiers.\\nThat was made clear by the second paragraph of Article X.8 which is quoted in para 11 above.\\nI would accept the submission made on behalf of the Buyers that it is clear that neither Article X.5 nor Article X.8 was intended to set out all the circumstances in which the refund guarantees should operate.\\nFor example, there was no cross reference in Article X.8 to the Builders obligation under Article X.6 of the Contracts to refund the instalments paid in the event of actual or constructive total loss, although it is common ground that the Bonds did cover that obligation.\\nIn short, Article X.8 did not purport to dictate the final scope of the Bonds.\\nIn particular, it did not require that the guarantees should cover refund obligations only under Article X.5 and Article X.6 of the Contracts.\\nThere is a further curiosity in paragraph [2] of the Bonds.\\nIn describing the Buyers rights under the Contracts, it did not limit their rights to a refund of the pre delivery instalments of the price.\\nIt extended them to the case where the Buyers were entitled to the value of the Buyers Supplies delivered to the Shipyard (if any), although in so doing it failed accurately to reflect the contractual position in relation to termination as opposed to total loss, since under Article X.5 of the Contracts the obligation on termination was to return the Supplies, and only to (re)pay their value insofar as already incorporated into the Vessel.\\nIt would seem to follow from the Banks submission that para [2] defined the scope of the Banks obligations under para [3] that the expression all such sums due to you under the Contract included both the obligations to refund identified in para [2] and the obligation to pay the value of the Buyers Supplies (whatever that might cover).\\nThat was indeed the submission advanced in the Banks skeleton argument in the Court of Appeal.\\nIt is however a submission that is no longer advanced by either party.\\nThat is no doubt because the difficulty with it is that the Bonds were described as Advance Payment Bonds and the amount of each bond was US$26,640,000, which was the total amount of the second and subsequent instalments of the price, and because interest was only payable under para [3] of the Bonds from the respective dates of payment by [the Buyers] of such instalments, thus leaving no room for a right to payment of the value of Buyers Supplies under the Bonds.\\nSir Simon Tuckey took a different view of the construction of the critical clauses of the Bonds from that of Patten and Thorpe LJJ.\\nHe did so in para 28, where he was considering whether in the particular circumstances of the case the Judge should have had regard to considerations of commercial and business common sense.\\nHe said this: But should the judge's approach in this case have been more restricted as Mr Philipps contends? I do not think so.\\nThe title to Article X as a whole is \\\"Payment\\\" but it contains an assortment of different terms.\\nArticle X.8 is drafted on the basis that the form of guarantee which the parties contemplated would be annexed to the agreement.\\nThat would be the document to look at if one was trying to discover from the contract what the Buyer was looking for, not the reference back to Article X.5.\\nThis reference back is poorly drafted and quite capable of referring simply to the opening sentence of paragraph 5.\\nIt is difficult to construe it in a way which restricts the refund obligations which the bond was to cover, not least because there is no reference to the Article X.6 obligation to a refund following total or constructive loss of the vessel which both parties agree was to be covered by the bond.\\nBy the same token, no significance should be attached to the omission of the Article XII.3 refund obligation.\\nNor do I think there is anything in Mr Philipps' further point.\\nOn the happening of an Article XII.3 event the Buyer was entitled to a refund of its advance payments immediately.\\nIf that did not happen the contract was in a state of limbo: neither party could terminate at that stage.\\nIf the Builder did not proceed with the construction of the vessel, as would be extremely likely if it was insolvent, the Buyer could terminate for delay under Article XII.l but, under the terms of this article, only after 90 days plus 14 days notice.\\nOnly then could it call on the Bond.\\nI cannot see how any Buyer (or its financiers) could possibly be satisfied with this as a remedy in the situation where the Builder was insolvent or nearly so.\\nI agree with Sir Simon Tuckey and prefer his approach to that of the majority in the Court of Appeal.\\nIn all these circumstances, because of the difficulties in construing para [2] as setting out the sums due under the Bond, if I were focusing only on the language of the clause, I would be inclined to prefer the Buyers construction to that of the Bank.\\nI note in passing in this regard that the construction advanced by the Bank was something of an afterthought.\\nHowever, I recognize that, on the Buyers construction, it is not easy to see why paragraph [2] was included in the Bond at all, and that the Banks construction is arguable.\\nThis case is therefore a good example of the kind of case referred to in the authorities to which I have referred.\\nSince the language of paragraph [3] is capable of two meanings it is appropriate for the court to have regard to considerations of commercial common sense in resolving the question what a reasonable person would have understood the parties to have meant.\\nAs noted at para 17 above, at his para 18(iii) the Judge described the Banks construction of the Bonds as having what he called the surprising and uncommercial result that the Buyers would not be able to call on the Bonds on the happening of the event, namely insolvency of the Builder, which would be most likely to require the first class security.\\nI agree with Sir Simon Tuckey that an appellate court is entitled to take account of the fact that an experienced judge of the Commercial Court reached that conclusion.\\nIn any event, Sir Simon Tuckey expressed essentially the same view in strong terms at para 30: On the Bank's construction the Bonds covered each of the situations in which the Buyers were entitled to a return or refund of the advance payments which they had made under the contracts apart from the insolvency of the Builder.\\nNo credible commercial reason has been advanced as to why the parties (or the Buyers' financiers) should have agreed to this.\\nOn the contrary, it makes no commercial sense.\\nAs the judge said, insolvency of the Builder was the situation for which the security of an advance payment bond was most likely to be needed.\\nThe importance attached in these contracts to the obligation to refund in the event of insolvency can be seen from the fact that they required the refund to be made immediately.\\nIt defies commercial common sense to think that this, among all other such obligations, was the only one which the parties intended should not be secured.\\nHad the parties intended this surprising result I would have expected the contracts and the bonds to have spelt this out clearly but they do not do so.\\nI agree.\\nPatten LJs view to the contrary is summarised at para 51: For the reasons which I have given, I do not regard the alternative constructions of paragraph (3) advanced on this appeal as being in any way evenly balanced.\\nI also agree with Mr Philipps that it is impermissible to speculate on the reasons for omitting repayments in the event of insolvency from the bond.\\nAlthough the judge is right to say that cover for such event was, objectively speaking, desirable, that is not sufficient in itself to justify a departure from what would otherwise be the natural and obvious construction of the bond.\\nThere may be any number of reasons why the Builder was unable or unwilling to provide bank cover in the event of its insolvency and why the Buyer was prepared to take the risk.\\nThis is not a case in which the construction contended for would produce an absurd or irrational result in the sense described in the cases I have referred to and merely to say that no credible commercial reason has been advanced for the limited scope of the bond does, in my view, put us in real danger of substituting our own judgment of the commerciality of the transaction for that of those who were actually party to it.\\nAs Hoffmann LJ put it, after quoting from Lord Diplocks speech in The Antaios [1985] AC 191, if the language is capable of more than one construction, it is not necessary to conclude that a particular construction would produce an absurd or irrational result before having regard to the commercial purpose of the agreement.\\nSee, for example, per Hoffmann LJ quoted at para 23 above, where he said: But language is a very flexible instrument and, if it is capable of more than one construction, one chooses that which seems most likely to give effect to the commercial purpose of the agreement.\\nSee also the quotation from Longmore LJ at para 29 above, where he said that, if a clause is capable of two meanings, it is quite possible that neither meaning will flout common sense, but that, in such a case, it is much more appropriate to adopt the more, rather than the less, commercial construction.\\nIn para 51 Patten LJ appears to have accepted that no credible commercial reasons were advanced for the limited scope of the Bonds being advanced by the Bank.\\nMr Philipps submitted that it was not necessary for the Bank to address the question but I have no doubt that if he or the Bank had been able to think of a credible reason for excluding repayments in the event of the Builders insolvency, such a reason would have been at the forefront of the Banks case.\\nIn these circumstances I would, if necessary, go so far as to say that the omission of the obligation to make such re payments from the Bonds would flout common sense but it is not necessary to go so far.\\nI agree with the Judge and Sir Simon Tuckey that, of the two arguable constructions of paragraph [3] of the Bonds, the Buyers construction is to be preferred because it is consistent with the commercial purpose of the Bonds in a way in which the Banks construction is not.\\nI note that Thorpe LJ was initially inclined to agree with the conclusions of the Judge but, in the event, agreed with Patten LJ without giving any independent reasons of his own.\\nCONCLUSION\\nFor these reasons I would allow the appeal and restore the order of the Judge.\\n\"\n        ],\n

and (2) That the impugned notification in question was in contravention of clause (c) of article 304 of the constitution.\\n(3) That the impugned notification is discriminatory in character.\\n407 Dismissing the Writ Petitions, this Court, HELD: That Act is no doubt passed for development of minerals but while discharging its functions relating to development, if the State incidentally allows mining to be carried on in the public interest and levies in that connec tion a tax, it does not mean that the said tax should be used only for development of minerals and not for other purposes sanctioned by law.\\n[412B] The India Cement Ltd. etc.\\nvs The State of Tamil Nadu etc., [1989] 4 SC Judgment Today 190.\\nNo restriction is being imposed on the freedom of trade of the petitioners by the levy of royalty.\\nThe minerals belong to the Government and if anybody wants to have the right as a lessee to exploit the mines to the exclusion of others and to remove the minerals with a view to making profit, he has to pay a royalty imposed in accordance with law.\\n[412E] In the instant case, the levy is made under a law made by the Central Government.\\nIt is not an imposition made by a law made by the State Legislature on which alone, the re striction contemplated under article 304(b) applies.\\n[412F] If the Executive or the administrative authority acts in an arbitrary manner, its action would be bad in law and liable to be struck down by the Courts but the possibility of abuse of power or arbitrary exercise of power cannot invalidate the statute conferring the power or the power which has been conferred by it.\\n[413B C] Since the power exercised is legislative in character, the authority which is exercising the said power has the power to make Rules equitable by necessary implication.\\nNo express power need be conferred on such subordinate authori ty in order to make a classification for purposes of imple menting the policy of the Act under which the Rules are made.\\n[415G]\\n\",\n          \"The Company Law Board was constituted under Section 10E of the , and the Central Government delegated some of its powers under the Act, including those under Section 237, to the Board.\\nThe Government also framed rules under Section 642(1) read with Section 10E(5) called the Company Law Board (Procedure) Rules 1964, Rule 3 of which empowered the Chairman of the Board to distribute the business of the Board among himself and other member or members and to specify the cases or classes of cases which were to be considered jointly by the Board.\\nOn February 6, 1954, under the power vested in him by Rule 3 the Chairman passed an order specifying the cases that had to be considered jointly by himself and the only other member of the Board and distributing the remaining business between himself and the member.\\nUnder this order the business of ordering investigations under Sections 235 and 237 was allotted to himself to be performed by him singly.\\nOn May 19, 1965 an order was issued on behalf of the Company Law Board under Section 237(b) of the .\\nappointing four inspectors to investigate the affairs of the appellant company, on the ground that the Board was of the opinion that there were circumstances suggesting that the business of the appellant company was being conducted with intent to defraud its creditors, members or any other persons and that the persons concerned in the management of the affairs of the company had in connection therewith been guilty of fraud, misfeasence and other misconduct towards the company and its members.\\nSoon afterwards the appellants filed a petition under article 226 of the Constitution for the issue of a writ quashing the order of the Board on the grounds, inter alia, that the order had been issued mala fide that there was no material on which such an order could have been made, etc.\\nOne of the affidavits filed in reply to the petition was by the ,Chairman of the Company Law Board, in which it was contended, inter alia, that there was material on the basis of which the impugned order was issued and he had himself examined this material and formed the necessary opinion within the meaning of sec.\\n237(b) before the issue of the order; and that it was not competent for the court to go into the question of the adequacy or otherwise of such material.\\nIn the course of replying to some of the allegations in the petition it was stated in paragraph 14 of the affidavit, however, that from memoranda received from some ex directors of the company and other examination it appeared, inter alia, that there had been delay, bungling and faulty planning of the company 's main project ,resulting in double expenditure; that the company had incurred huge losses; there had been a sharp fall in the price of the company 's SCI 22 312 shares; and some eminent persons had resigned from the Board of Directors of the company because of differences with the Managing Director on account of the manner in which the affairs of the company were being conducted.\\nThe appellant 's petition was dismissed by the High Court.\\nIn the appeal to this Court it was contended on behalf of the appellants: (1) That the order was made made fide on account of the competing interests of a firm in which the Minister in charge of the department was interested and also because of his personal hostility against the second petitioner who was the managing director of the company; that the High Court had erred in deciding the petition on the footing that the first respondent Board was an independent authority and that it was its Chairman who on his own had formed the requisite opinion and passed the order and therefore the motive or the evil eye of the Minister was irrelevant; the High Court also erred in failing to appreciate that even though the impugned order was by the Chairman, as under section 10E(6) it had to receive and in fact received the Minister 's agreement, if the Minister 's mala fides were established, that would vitiate the order; furthermore, in the circumstances of the case.\\nthe High Court ought to have allowed the appellants an opportunity to establish their case of mala fide by the cross examination of the Minister and the Chairman, both of whom had filed affidavits.\\n(2) That clause (b) of Section 237 required two things: (i) the requisite opinion of the Central Government, in the present case, of the Board, and (ii) the existence of circumstances suggesting that the company 's business was being conducted as laid down in sub clause (i) or that the persons mentioned in sub clause (ii) were guilty of fraud, misfeasance or misconduct towards the company or any of its members; though the opinion to be formed is subjective, the existence of circumstances set out in cl.\\n(b) is a condition precedent to the formation of such opinion and therefore even if the impugned order were to contain a recital of the existence of those circumstances, the court can go behind that recital and determine whether they did in fact exist, that even taking the circumstances said to have been found by the respondent Board, they were extraneous to see.\\n237(b) and could not constitute a basis for the impugned order.\\n(3) That the impugned order was in fact made on the basis of allegations contained in memoranda submitted by four ex directors of the company who continued to be shareholders; and by ordering an investigation under section 237(b) the respondent Board had in effect enabled these shareholders to circumvent the provisions of section 235 and section 236.\\nOn this ground also the impugned order was therefore made mala fide or was otherwise invalid.\\n(4) That the impugned order was in any case bad as it was passed by the Chairman of the Respondent Board alone acting under rules under which such a power was conferred in contravention of the provisions of Section 10E.\\nThe power under section 237 was delegated by the Central Government to the Board as a whole and could not in turn be sub delegated to the Chairman alone in the absence of a provision such as sub sec.\\n(4A) added to sec.\\n10E after the impugned order was issued, and which now enabled the solidarity of the Board to be broken.\\nSuch sub delegation could not be done in accordance with rules made under section 10E(5) which merely enabled the procedure of the Board to be regulated.\\n313 (5) That the impugned order was bad because Section 237(b) itself was bad as offending against articles 14 and 19 of the Constitution.\\nHELD: (By Hidayatullah.\\nBachawat and Shelat, JJ., Sarkar C.J. and Mudholkar J. dissenting): The impugned order must be set aside.\\n(1) (By the Court): The respondents had failed to show that the impugned order was passed mala fide.\\nL330 E; 335 B C; F G].\\n(Per Sarkar C.J. and Mudholkar J.3: The decision to order the investigation was taken by the Chairman of the respondent Board and there was nothing to indicate that in arriving at that decision he was influenced by the Minister.\\nIf the decision arrived at by the Chairman was an independent one, it could not be said to have been rendered mala fide because it was later approved by the Minister.\\n[320 D].\\nIn a proceeding under article 226 of the Constitution, the normal rule is, as pointed out by this Court in The State of Bombay vs Purshottam Jog Naik ; , to decide disputed questions on the basis of affidavits and that it is within the discretion of the High Court whether to allow a person who has sworn an affidavit before it to be cross examined or not.\\nThe High Court having refused permission for the cross examination, it would not be appropriate for this Court, while hearing an appeal.\\nby special leave, to interfere lightly with the exercise of its discretion.\\n[320 G H; 321 A].\\n(Per Shelat J.): The allegations of mala fides in the petition were not grounded on any knowledge but only on \\\"reasons to believe\\\".\\nEven for their reasons to believe, the appellants had not disclosed any information on which they were founded.\\nNo particulars of the main allegations were given.\\nAlthough in a case of this kind it would be difficult for a petitioner to have personal knowledge in regard to an averment of mala fides, where such knowledge is wanting, he must disclose his source of information so that the other side gets a fair chance to verify it and make an effective answer.\\nIn the absence of tangible materials, the only answer which the respondents could array against the allegations as to mala fides would be one of general denial.\\n[352 D H].\\nIn a petition under article 226, there is undoubtedly ample power in the High Court to order attendance of a deponent in court for being cross examined.\\nWhere it is not possible for the court to arrive at a definite conclusion on account of there being affidavits on either side containing allegations and counter allegations, it would not only be desirable but in the interest of justice the duty also of the court to summon a deponent for cross examination in order to arrive at the truth.\\nHowever, the High Court was rightly of the view that in the present case even if the two deponents were to be called for cross examination, they could in the absence of particulars of allegations of mala fides and the other circumstances of the case, only repeat their denials in the affidavits of the allegations in the petition and therefore such cross examination would not take the court any further than the affidavits.\\n[353 D H].\\n(2) (Per Hidayatullah, Bachawat and Shelat JJ.\\nSarkar, C. J. and Mudholkar J. dissenting,):The circumstances disclosed in paragraph 14 of the affidavit must be regarded as the only materials on the basis of which the respondent Board formed the opinion before ordering an investigation under Section 237(b).\\nThese circumstances could not reasonably suggest that the business of the company was being conducted to defraud the creditors, members or other L/S5SCI 22(a) 314 persons or that the management was guilty of fraud towards the company and its members; they were therefore, extraneous to the matters mentioned in section 237(b) and the impugned order was ultra vires the Section.\\n[339 A D, G H; 340 A; 342 G H; 343 AC; 365 D E; 367 A C].\\n(Per Hidayatullah J.): The power under Section 237(b) in a discretionary power and the first requirement for its exercise is the 'honest formation of an opinion that an investigation is necessary.\\n,The next requirement is that \\\"there are circumstances suggesting\\\" the inferences stout in the Section.\\nAn action, not based on circumstances suggesting an inference of the enumerated kind will not be valid.\\nNo doubt the formation of opinion is subjective but the existence of circumstances relevant to the inference as the sine qua non for action must be demonstrable.\\nIf their existence is questioned, it has to be proved at least prima facie.\\nIt is not sufficient to assert, that the circumstances exist and give no clue to what they are, because the circumstances must be such as to lead to conclusions of certain definiteness.\\nThe conclusions must relate to an intent to defraud, a :fraudulent or unlawful purpose, fraud or misconduct or the withholding of information of a particular kind.\\n[335 F H; 336 G H] An examination of the affidavit filed by the Chairman of the respondent Board showed that the material examined by the Chairman merely indicated the need for a deeper probe.\\nThis was not sufficient.\\nThe material must suggest certain inferences and not the need for \\\"a deeper probe\\\".\\nThe former is a definite conclusion the 'latter a mere fishing expedition.\\n[338 E H].\\n(Per Shelat J.): Althouugh the formation of opinion by cen tral Government is a purely subjective process and such an opinion cannot be challenged in a court on the ground of propriety, reasonableness or sufficiency, the Authority concerned is nevertheless required to arrive at such an opinion from circumstances suggesting what is set out in sub clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of section 237 (b).\\nThe expres sion \\\"circumstances suggesting\\\" cannot support the construction that even the existence of circumstances is a matter of subjective opinion.\\nIt is hard to contemplate that the legislature could have left to the subjective process both the formation of opinion and also the existence of circumstances on which it is to be founded.\\nIt is also not reasonable to say that the clause permitted the Authority to say that it has formed the opinion on 'circumstances which in its opinion exist and which in its opinion suggest an intent to defraud or a fraudulent or unlawful purpose.\\nIf it is shown that the circumstances do not exist or that they are such that it is impossible for any one to form an opinion therefrom suggestive of the matters enumerated in section 237 (b) the opinion is challengeable on the ground 'of non application of mind or perversity or on the ground that it was formed on collateral grounds and was beyond the scope of the statute.\\n[362 H; 363 A G].\\n(Per Sarkar C.J., and Mudholkar J. dissenting): An examina tion of section 237 would show that cl.\\n(b) thereof confers a discretion upon the 'Board to appoint an Inspector to investigate the affairs of a company.\\nThe words \\\"in the opinion of\\\" govern the word \\\"there are circumstances suggesting\\\" and not the words \\\"may do so\\\".\\nThe words 'circumstances ' and 'suggesting ' cannot be dissociated without making it impossible for the Board to form an 'opinion ' at all.\\nThe formation of an opinion must, 'therefore, be as to whether there are circumstances suggesting the existence of one or more of 'the matters in sub cls.\\n(i) to (iii) and not about anything else.\\nThe opinion must of course not have been arrived at mala fide.\\nTo say that the, opinion to be formed must be as to the necessity 315 of making an investigation would be making a clear departure from the language in which section 237(b) is couched.\\nIt is only after the formation of certain opinion by the Board that the stage for exercising the discretion conferred by the provision is reached.\\nThe discretion conferred to order an investigation is administrative and not judicial since its exercise one way or the other does not affect the rights of a company nor does it lead to any serious consequences as, for instance, hampering the business of the company.\\nAs has been pointed out by this Court in Raja Narayanalal Bansilal vs Maneck Phiroz Mistry and Anr. , the investigation undertaken under this provision is for ascertaining facts and is thus merely exploratory.\\nThe scope for judicial review of the action of the Board must, therefore be strictly limited.\\nIf it can be shown that the Board had in fact not formed an opinion its order could be successfully challenged.\\nThere is a difference between not forming an opinion at all and forming an opinion upon grounds, which, if a court could go into that question at all, could be regarded as inapt or insufficient or irrelevant.\\nThe circumstances set out in paragraph 14 of the affidavit of the Chairman of the respondent Board were nothing more than certain conclusions drawn by the Board from some of the material which it had before it.\\nMoreover, the expression \\\"inter alia\\\" used by the Chairman would show that the conclusions set out by him specifically were not the only ones which could be drawn from the material before the Board.\\nIt would not therefore be right to construe the affidavit to mean that the only conclusions emerging from the material before the Board were those set out in paragraph 14.\\n[352 A E].\\n(3) (Per Sarkar C. J. and Mudholkar J.): As it could not be said that the investigation had been ordered either at the instance of 4 ex directors of the company or on the sole basis of the memoranda submitted by them, there was no contravention of the provisions of Sections 235 and 236 of the Act.\\n[328 C, E].\\n(4) (Per Sarkar C. J., Mudholkar and Bachawat JJ.\\n, Hidayatullah and Shelat JJ., dissenting): Rule 3 of the Company Law Board (Procedure) Rules, 1964, and the order dated April 6, 1964 made pursuant thereto distributing the business of the Board, were both valid.\\nThe impugned order was not therefore invalid because it was made by the Chairman alone and not by the Board.\\n[330 C. D; 342 B C].\\n(Per Sarkar C.J. and Mudholkar J.): Bearing in mind the fact that the power conferred by Section 237(b) is merely administrative, the allocation of the business of the Board relating to the exercise of such power must be regarded as a matter of procedure.\\nStrictly speaking the Chairman to whom the business of the Board is allocated does not become a delegate of the Board at all.\\nHe acts in the name of the Board and is no more than its agent.\\nBut even if he is looked upon as a delegate of the Board and, therefore, sub delegate vis avis the Central Government, he would be as much subject to the control of the Central Government as the Board itself, for sub section\\n(6) of section 10E provides that the Board shall, in the exercise of the powers delegated to it, be subject to the control of the Central Government and the order distributing the business was made with permission of the Central Government.\\nBearing in mind that the maxim delegates non protest delegable sets out what is merely a rule of construction, subdelegation can be sustained if permitted by an express provision or by necessary implication.\\nWhere, as here, what is sub delegated is an administrative power and control over its exercise is retained by the nominee of Parliament, that is, here the Central Government, the power to make a delegation may be inferred, [329 F H; 330 A C].\\n316 (Per Bachwat J.): The function under section 237(b) involves the exercise of a discretion.\\nPrima facie all the members of the Board acting together were required to discharge this function and they could not delegate their duty to the Chairman.\\nHowever, under sections 10E(5) and 642(1), the Central Government may frame rules regulating the procedure of the Board and generally to carry out the purpose of the Act.\\nIn the context of section 10E, the rule making power should be construed liberally.\\nThe Central Government has power to constitute the Company Law Board, to delegate its function to the Board and to control the Board in the exercise of its delegated functions.\\nIn this background, by conferring on the Central Government the additional power of framing rules regulating the procedure of the Board and generally to carry out the purposes of section 10E Parliament must have intended that the internal Organisation of the Board and the mode and manner of transacting its business should be regulated entirely by rules framed by the Government.\\nThe Government had, therefore, power to frame the Company Law Board (Procedure) Rules.\\n1964 authorising the Chairman to distribute the business of the Board.\\nIn the exercise of the power conferred by this rule, the Chairman assioned the business under section 237 to himself.\\nThe Chairman alone could, therefore, pass the impugned order.\\n[341 F H; 342 A C].\\n(Per Hidayatullah J.): The new sub section 4A of Section 10E, which was not there when the impugned order was made.\\nenables the work of the Board to be distributed among members, while sub section\\n(5) merely enables the procedure of the Board to be regulated.\\nThese are two very different things.\\nOne provides for distribution of work in such a way that each constituent part of the Board, properly autho rised.\\nbecomes the Board.\\nThe other provides for the procedure of the Board.\\nWhat is the Board is not a question which admits of solution by procedural rules but by the enactment of a substantive provision allowing for a different delegation.\\nSuch an enactment has been framed in relation to the Tribunal constituted under section 10B and has now been framed under section 10E also.\\nThe new sub section involves a delegation of the powers of the Central Government to a member of the Board which the Act previously allowed to be made to the Board only.\\nThe statute, as it was formerly, gave no authority to delegate if differently or to another person or persons.\\nWhen it spoke of procedure in sub section (5) it spoke of the procedure of the Board As constitlited.\\nThe lacuna in the Act must have felt; otherwise there was no need to enact sub section (4A), [334 B E].\\n(Per Shelat T.): The statute having permitted the delegation of powers to the Board only as the statutory Authority the powers so delegated have to be exercised by the Board and not by its components.\\nTo authorise its Chairman to hand over those functions and powers to the.\\nBoard only as the statutory Authority, the powers so by the Act.\\nThe effect of r. 3 and the order of distribution of work made in pursuance thereof was not laying down a procedure but au thorising and, making a sub delegation in favour of the members.\\nThe only procedure which the Government could prescribe was the procedure in relation to Board the manner in which it should discharge and exercise the functions and Powers delegated to it, but it could not make a provision which under the cloak of procedure authorised sub delegation.\\n[369 F H; 370 A, B].\\n(5) (By the Court): The provisions of Section 237(b) were not violative of Articles 14 and 19 of the Constitution.\\n[328 F G; 342 D F; 371 H].\\nSections 234, 235, 236 and 237(b) gave power to different authorities i.e. the Registrar and the Government, provided powers which 317 are different in extent and nature, exercisable in sets of circumstances and in a manner different from one another.\\nTherefore, there is no question of discriminatory power having been vested in the Government under these Sections to pick and choose between (one company and the other.\\n[370 G, H].\\nWhen investigation is ordered, there would be inconvenience in the carrying on of the business of the company.\\nIt might also perhaps shake the credit of a company.\\nBut an investigation directed under section 237(b) is essentially of an exploratory character and it is not as if any restriction is placed on the right of the concerned company to carry on its business and no restrictions are imposed on those who carry on the company 's affairs.\\nEven if it is regarded as a restriction, it is not possible to say that it is not protected as a reasonable restriction under Clause 6 of article 19(1).\\n[371 B D].\\nCase law referred to.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 199,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"<s>[INST] Summarize the following judgement: etition (Civil) Nos.\\n12676 77 of 1985 etc.\\n(Under Article 32 of the Constitution of India) R.F.

Mehta for the Respondents.\\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by VENKATARAMIAH, CJ.\\nThe petitioners in these petitions have questioned the validity of a notification issued by the Government of Gujarat on June 26, 1985 in exercise of its powers conferred by Section 15 of the (67 of 1957), herein after referred to as the Act, amending the Gujarat Minor Mineral Rules 1966, hereinafter referred to as the Rules, with effect from 1 7 1985 substituting the original rule 21 of the Rules by a new rule which reads as follows: \\\"21.\\nRate of Royality: The holder of a quarry lease or any other mineral concession granted under these rules shall pay royalty in respect of minor minerals, specified in column 2 of the schedule, removed or consumed by him or by his agent, manager, employee, contractor or sub lessee from the leased area at the rates respectively specified against them in column 3 of the said schedule.\\nProvided that: (i) the holder of a Parwana granted under these rules shall pay royalty at the rate of fifty percent of the rate of royalty specified in the said schedule.\\n(ii) no royalty shall be charged from Nimbha das of village potters who manufacture upto one lakh bricks per year.\\n(iii) no royalty shall be charged from Nimbha das of village potters if their annual produc tion is not exceeding two lakhs bricks and they supply at least one lakh bricks to the Rural Housing Board or Panchayats.\\n(iv) Royalty shall be recoverable in whole rupees, fraction fifty paise and above to be rounded upwards to a whole rupee and fraction below fifty paise shall be ignored\\\" and fixing the royalty payable by the lessees in respect of minor minerals known as Black Trap and Hard Murrum at Rs.7 per metric tonne by amending schedule of the Rules which was being levied at Rs. 4 till the date of the said amendment.\\n409 In order to understand the case of the petitioners it is necessary to set out some other provisions of law governing the case.\\nThe Act was passed in the year 1957 by Parliament to provide for the regulation of mines and development of minerals under the control of the Union and it was made applicable to the whole of India.\\nUnder section 3A of the Act the word 'minerals ' is defined as including all minerals except mineral oils.\\nClause (e) of the said section defines 'minor minerals ' as building stones, gravel, ordinary clay, ordinary sand other than sand used for prescribed purposes and any other mineral which the Central Government may.\\nby notification in the Official Gazette, declare to be a minor mineral.\\nIt is not disputed that Black Trap and Hard Murrum are notified as minor minerals.\\nThe Act has made provision with regard to the issue of prospecting licences and mining leases in respect of various kinds of minerals other than minor minerals and the procedure to be followed in that connection in the matter of issue of prospecting licences and mining leases.\\nSection 9 of the act empowers the Central Government to levy royalty in respect of the minerals which are won by the mining lease holders under the Act at the rates prescribed in the Second Schedule to the Act.\\nIt empowers the Central Government to enhance or reduce the rate of royalty prescribed by the Second Schedule in respect of any mineral subject to the condition that the Central Government shall not enhance the rate of royalty in respect of any mineral more than once during any period of three years.\\nSection 14 of the Act provides that sections 5 to 13 (inclusive) shall not apply to quarry leases, mining leases or other mineral concessions in respect of minor minerals.\\nSection 15 as it stood during the relevant time read thus: \\\"15.\\n(1) The State Government may, by notifi cation in the Official Gazette, make rules for regulating the grant of (quarry leases, mining leases or other mineral concessions) in re spect of minor minerals and for purposes connected therewith.\\n(2) Until rules are made under sub section (1), my rules made by a State Government regulating the grant of (quarry leases, mining leases or other mineral concessions) in re spect of minor minerals which are in force immediately before the commencement of this Act shall continue in force.\\n(3) The holder of a mining lease or any other mineral concession granted under any rule made under sub section (1) 410 shall pay royalty or dead rent, whichever is more in respect of minor minerals removed or consumed by him or by his agent, manager, employee, contractor or sub lessee at the rate prescribed for the time being in the rules framed by the State Government in respect of minor minerals; Provided that the State Government shall not enhance the rate of royalty in respect of any minor mineral for more than once during any period of three years.\\n\\\" It is seen from section 15 that the State Government is empowered to make rules for regulating the grant of quarry leases, mining leases or other mineral concessions in re spect of minor minerals and for purposes connected there with.\\nIn exercise of the said power under section 15 the Government of Gujarat promulgated the Gujarat Minor Minerals Rules, 1966 which are referred to as the Rules as stated above.\\nRule 21 of the Rules provides for the determination of the rate of royalty payable in respect of minor minerals.\\nThe original rule 21 was substituted by new rule 21 by the issue of impugned notification on 26 6 1985 which provides that a holder of a quarry lease or any other mineral conces sion granted under the Rules shall pay royalty in respect of minor minerals provided in column 2 of the Schedule, removed or consumed by him or by his agent, manager, employee, contractor or sub lessee from the leased area at the rates specified in column 3 of the said Schedule.\\nIt is under this notification the rate of royalty in respect of black trap and Hard Murrum was increased from Rs. 4 to Rs.7 per metric tonne.\\nThe rule also provides that the holder of a Parwana granted under the Rules shall pay royalty at the rate of 50 per cent of the rate of royalty specified in the said Sched ule and that no royalty shall be charged from Nimbhadas of village Potters who manufacture upto one lakh bricks per year.\\nIt further provides that no royalty shall be charged from Nimbhadas of villages potters if the annual production is not exceeding two lakh bricks and they supply at least one lakh bricks to the Rural Housing Board or Panchayats.\\nThe validity of rule 21 as it existed prior to the issue of the impugned notification was considered in B.K. Trivedi & Sons and Ors.\\nvs State of Gujarat and Ors.\\n, ; as under the said rule the royalty payable in respect of some of the minor minerals had been enhanced.\\nOriginally all lessees had to pay a minimum dead rent in respect of the area covered by a minor mineral lease issued in respect of any minor mineral or the royalty prescribed in respect of quantity of minor minerals owned by him, which ever was higher.\\nThe history of the legislation of the Rule from the year 1986 is set out in detail in the said 411 decision.\\nHence it is not necessary to refer to it in detail here.\\nBy the said decision the constitutionality of section 15 of the Act and the validity of a notification issued on June 18, 1981 under which the rate of royalty had been raised was upheld and the writ petitions in which the said validity had been questioned were dismissed.\\nThat decision was rendered on March 5, 1986.\\nDuring the pendency of the said petitions in the High Court the impugned notification was issued increasing the royalty payable in respect of Black Trap and Hard Murrum from Rs.4 to Rs.7.\\nIn these petitions the impugned notification issued in the year 1985 is questioned.\\nSince many of the contentions raised by the parties in respect of the constitutionality of section 15 of the Act and the validity of Rules made thereunder had been considered and the contentions urged by the petitioners against the said rule in those petitions had been rejected, in the present case the petitioners have confined their case only to the following points which according to them had not been considered in the said decision.\\nShri R.F. Nariman, learned counsel for the petitioners in some of the petitions had two contentions: 1. that the royalty levied and covered under the Rules should be applied only for mineral development and since the said royalty is being treated as part of the consolidated fund of the State and used for other purposes by the State the levy was bad; and 2.\\nthat the impugned notification in question was in contravention of clause (b) of Article 304 of the Constitution.\\nThe contention of the learned counsel was that under Entry 50 of List II of the 7th Schedule to the Constitution, the royalty recovered by the State Government had to be used only for mineral development and could not be used for any other purpose.\\nAccording to him the Act had been passed for purposes of regulation and development of minerals.\\nHe depended upon the language of Entry 50 which reads thus: \\\"taxes on mineral rights subject to any limitations imposed by Parliament by law relating to mineral development\\\" We do not find much substance in this contention.\\nRe cently a Constitution Bench of this Court has held in The India Cement Ltd. etc.\\nvs The State of Tamil Nadu etc., [1989] 4 S.C. Judgments Today 190 that the royalty levied on the extracted mineral was in the nature of a tax and it was not in the nature of a fee which could be used 412 only for specific purposes.\\nAny tax realised by the State Government forms part of the consolidated fund of the State and the said tax can be used by the State Government for any of the purposes to which its executive powers extend subject to any law made by the State Legislature in that regard.\\nWe do not, therefore, find any substance in the above conten tion.\\nIt is no doubt true that the Act is passed for devel opment of minerals, but while discharging its functions relating to development, if the State incidentally allows mining to be carried on in the public interest and levies in that connection a tax, it does not mean that the said tax should be used only for development of minerals and not for other purposes sanctioned by law.\\nIn support of the second contention the learned counsel Shri Nariman argued that notwithstanding anything contained in Article 301 or Article 303 the Legislature of a State may by law impose such reasonable restrictions on the freedom of trade, commerce or intercourse with or within that State as required in the public interest.\\nProvided that no Bill or amendment for the purpose of sub clause (b) shall be intro duced or moved in the legislature of a State without the previous sanction of the president.\\nWe do not find that clause (b) of Article 304 has any relevance on the point in question.\\nNo restriction is being imposed on the freedom of trade of the petitioners by the levy of royalty.\\nThe minerals belong to the Government and if anybody wants to have the right as a lessee to exploit the mines in question to the exclusion of all others and to remove the minerals with a view to making profit, he has to pay a royalty imposed in accordance with law.\\nIn the instant case the levy is made under a law made by the Central Gov ernment.\\nIt is not an imposition made by a law made by the State Legislature on which alone the restriction contemplat ed under Article 304(b) applies.\\nWe do not also find much substance in the contention that the levy in question is unreasonably heavy and has been imposed in an arbitrary manner.\\nThe burden of establishing that the levy is unreasonably heavy, is on the petitioners.\\nIt is urged that in the other States the royalty is being levied at the rate of Re. 1 per metric tonne of Black Trap and Hard Murrum and Rs.7 levied in the notification is excessive.\\nThe fact that in other States the royalty is fixed at Re. 1 is not by itself sufficient to hold that Rs.7 per metric tonne is unreasonably high rate of royalty.\\nIn Trivedi 's case (supra) this Court had upheld the levy of Rs.4 per metric tonne which had been fixed in 1981 and in 1985 it was increased to Rs.7.\\nHaving regard to the depreci ation in the value of 413 the rupee and the increase in the cost of ' administration of the State, which is ever increasing, as a welfare State we cannot say that Rs.7 is an unreasonably high rate.\\nWe have taken this view after going through the observations made by this Court in Trivedi 's case (supra) at page 544 where this Court has observed that where a statute confers discretion ary powers upon the executive or an administrative authori ty, the validity or constitutionality of such power cannot be judged on the assumption that the executive or such authority will act in an arbitrary manner in the exercise of the discretion conferred upon it.\\nIf the executive or the administrative authority acts in an arbitrary manner, its action would be bad in law and liable to be struck down by the courts but the possibility of abuse of power or arbi trary exercise of power cannot invalidate the statute con ferring the power or the power which has been conferred by it.\\nWe do not find that the levy is arbitrarily imposed.\\nIt is obvious that the petitioners are lessees who are exploiting the mining areas for purposes of business and that the royalty in question is ultimately passed on to the consumers.\\nIt is not shown that the business ,of the peti tioners has been adversely affected in such a way that it is liable to be struck down on the ground of arbitrariness.\\nWe do not, therefore, find any substance in the contention urged by Shri Nariman.\\nIn Civil Writ Petition No. 618 of 1987 filed by Jai Sholanath Quarry Works and another, Mr. Keswani, learned counsel for the petitioners contended that the impugned rule 21 which was substituted in the place of the former rule 21 was invalid as it was discriminatory in character.\\nHe con tended that the concession shown in favour of Parwana hold ers was discriminatory and violative of Article 14.\\nUnder clause 1 of the proviso to the impugned rule 21, a holder of a Parwana granted under the Rules has to pay royalty at the rate of 50 per cent of the royalty payable by the lessees and no royalty is payable by village potters who manufacture upto one lakh bricks per year and by the village potters whose annual production was not exceeding two lakh bricks and who supply at least one lakh bricks to the Rural Housing Board or Panchayats.\\nHis contention was that section 15 of the Act which authorised the State Government to make rules in respect of minor minerals does not specifically authorise the State Government to make such discrimination.\\nWe find no substance in this contention too.\\nIt is obvious that a valid classification of persons and things for 414 purposes of imposing any obligation on them would not be violative of Article 14 provided the classification is a reasonable one.\\nIt is well settled that a classification to be valid has to satisfy two conditions: (1) that there is an intelligible differentia between those who are included in the class which is affected by any law or rule and those who are placed outside the said rule; and (2) that there is a reasonable nexus between the classification and the object to be achieved by the rule or law in question.\\nThe Act under the Rules was made for purposes of regu lation and development and conservation of minerals.\\nIt is equally clear that while levying a tax the authority con cerned is entitled to grant concessions and exemptions wherever necessary having regard to the purpose of the Act, the levy of royalty is incidental to the regulation and development of minerals.\\nMany a time absence of such classi fication may itself result in the invalidation of the law or rule.\\nWhoever is given an exclusive right to exploit a mine will have to pay some amount by way of return to the Govern ment of India as authorised by entry 50 of List II of the 7th Schedule to the Constitution.\\nHaving regard to the broad policy underlying the Constitution if a concession is shown in favour of the poor and the down trodden, it cannot be said that the exemption or concession is invalid.\\nAccording to rule 2(vi)(a) of the Rules a \\\"quarrying Parwana\\\" means a quarrying Parwana granted under these rules to extract and remove any minor mineral from land not exceeding a specified area.\\nRule 33 A provides that the competent officer may notify areas of limestone, Black Trap, sand stone and build ing stones for the purpose of grant of quarrying parawana, as he deems fit.\\nWhen any area is so notified, no quarry lease shall be granted for such notified area.\\nRule 33 B of the Rules reads thus: \\\"33.B. Grant of quarrying Parwana On an application made to the competent officer, he may grant a quarrying Parwana to extract and remove from the specified area within his jurisdiction the minor mineral from a plot not exceeding 2,000 square meters, as may be specified by the competent officer.\\nThe compe tent officer may grant such Parwana in the following priorities: (a) Individual families to Khanias belonging to the Scheduled Castes or the Scheduled Tribes, who do physical work I of excavating minor mineral in the area applied for. 415 (b) Individual families of 'Khanias ' who do physical work in excavating minor minerals in the area applied for.\\n(c) New individual Khanias who do physical work in excavating minor minerals in any other areas.\\n\\\" Rule 33 C provides that the lease shall be granted for one year ending 31st December on a payment of a fee of Rs.50 for an area upto 1,000 square meters and Rs. 100 for an area above 1,000 square meters and upto 2,000 square meters.\\nThus it is seen that a Parwana can be given only respect of plots not exceeding 2,000 square meters and for a limited period of one year.\\nIt is only in the case of such people who are described in the Rules and who invariably belong to the weaker sections of society the concession is shown under rule 21, whereas the mining lease may be given to persons mentioned in rule 9.\\nUnder rule 18 of the Rules the period of lease in the case of the minor minerals can be for a much longer period, it can be upto 10 years in respect of minor minerals except in the case of ordinary sand, Kankar, Mur ram, Gravel and in the case of Kankar, Murram and gravel a lease can be granted upto three years, and the area or land covered by a mining lease is governed by rule 15 which says that no quarry lease shall be granted for an area exceeding 10 hectares in case of specified minor mineral and 20 hec tares in the case of other minerals.\\nSo a comparison of the relevant rules would show that a larger restriction is imposed both on the area in respect of which a Parwana could be issued and the duration of the Parwana right and as also stated that the persons who take quarrying Parwana are persons belonging to the weaker sections of society and if under rule 21 a concession is shown in their favour it cannot be said that there is no reasonable nexus between the classification for purposes of the proviso to rule 21 to show concession in the matter of payment of royalty and the social policy underlying the Constitution, the statute and the Rules.\\nThe fact that section 15 of the Act does no authorise the State Government to show such concession while promulgating the Rules which are in the nature of subordi nate legislation is also of no consequence.\\nSince the power exercised is legislative in character the authority which is exercising the said power has the power to make rules equi table by necessary implication.\\nNo express power need to conferred on such subordinate authority in order to make a classification for purposes of implementing the policy of the Act under which the Rules are made.\\nWe do not also agree with the contention that levying of royalty in the State of Gujarat on the minor minerals would impose in any way 416 the freedom guaranteed under Article 301 of the Constitution regarding movement of goods from one State to another for the activity of quarrying does not involve any movement as such.\\nThe mineral may be consumed inside the State and in some cases may latter on be taken outside the State.\\nBut the movement outside the State is not the direct consequence of quarrying.\\nWe do not, therefore, find any substance in any of the contentions urged before us.\\nThese petitions are dismissed with costs.\\nEach of the petitioners shall pay a sum of Rs.2,000 by way of costs to the State of Gujarat.\\nY.

C. Dutt on behalf of the Board by virtue of the powers conferred on him by certain rules to which we shall refer later.\\nOn June 4, 1965 the Company preferred a writ petition under article 226 of the Constitution in the Punjab High Court for the issue of a writ of mandamus or other appropriate writ, direction or order quashing the order of the Board dated May 19, 1965.\\nThe Managing Director, Mr. Balasubramanian joined in the petition as petitioner No. 2.\\nThe writ petition is directed against 7 respondents, the first of which is the 318 Company Law Board.\\nThe second respondent is Mr. T. T. Krishnamachari, who was at that time Minister for Finance in the Government of India.\\nThe Inspectors: appointed are respondents 3 to 6 and Mr. Dang is the 7th respondent.\\nApart from the relief of quashing the order of May 19, 1965 the appellants sought the ' issue of a writ restraining the Company Law Board and the Inspectors from giving effect to the order dated May 19, 1965 and also sought some other incidental reliefs.\\nThe order of the Board was challenged on 5 grounds which are briefly as follows: (1) that the order was made mala fide; (2) that in making the order the Board had acted on material extraneous to the matters mentioned in section 237(b) of the ; (3) that the order having in fact been made at the instance of the shareholders is invalid and on a true construction of section 237 this could not be done; (4) that the order was invalid because it was made by the Chairman of the Board and not by the Board; and (5) that the provisions of section 237(b) are void as offending articles 14 and 19(1) (g) of the Constitution.\\nThe allegations of mala fides were denied on behalf of the respondents.\\nThey disputed the validity of all the other grounds raised by the petitioners.\\nThe High Court rejected the contentions urged before it on behalf of the appellants and dismissed the writ petition.\\nThe appellants thereafter sought to obtain a certificate of fitness for appeal to this Court; but the High Court refused to grant such a certificate.\\nThey have now come up to this Court by special leave.\\nIn order to appreciate the arguments addressed before us a brief statement of the relevant facts would be necessary.\\nThe Company was registered in the year 1961 and had an authorised capital of Rs. 1 crore divided into 1,00,000 shares of Rs. 100 each.\\nIts primary object was to carry on business of manufacturing all types of barium compounds.\\nAppellant No. 2 was appointed Managing Director of the Company from December 5, 1961 and his appointment and remuneration were approved by the Central Government on July 30, 1962.\\nThe erection of the plant was undertaken by M/s. L. A. Mitchell Ltd., of Manchester in pursuance of a collaboration agreement between it and the company entered in October, 1961 and approved by the Central Government in November of that year.\\nThereafter a permit for importing the requisite machinery was granted to the Company.\\nThe issued capital of the Company was Rs. 50, 00,000 and the public was invited to subscribe for shares in the Company.\\nIt is said that the issue was oversubscribed by March 12, 1962.\\n319 It would see that soon after the collaboration agreement was entered into M/s. L. A. Mitchell Ltd., was taken over by a financial group (M/s. Pearwn, & Co. Ltd.), to which a. person named Lord Poole belonged.\\nIt would appear that as the work of setting up of the plant was being delayed the Company sent a notice to M/s Mitchell Ltd. , on April 2, 1965 in which the Company stated that if the plant was not completely installed and got into running order by June 1, 1965 the Company will have to make alternative arrangements and that it would hold M/s. L. A. Mitchell Ltd., liable to pay damages to the Company for the loss suffered by it.\\nAs a result of the notice Lord Poole visited India in April/May, 1965.\\nIn his opinion the design of the plant was defective.\\nCertain negotiations took place between the Company and Lord Poole in the course of which an undertaking was given by Lord Poole on at behalf of the collaborators that the work would be completed with necessary alterations and modifications in accordance with the report of M/s. Humphrey & Co., and that the collaborators would spend an additional amount upto pound 250,000 as may be required for the purpose.\\nIt is said that the plaint was producing at that time only 25 per cent of its installed capacity but that according to the assurance given by Lord Poole it would yield full production by April, 1966.\\nAccording to the appellants, before entering into a collaboration agreement with M/s. L. A. Mitchell Ltd., the appellant No. 2 Balasubramanian was negotiating with a German firm named Kali Chemie A. G. of Hanover for obtaining their collaboration.\\nIt is said that the firm of M/s. T. T. Krishnamachari & Sons were and still are the sole agents in India for some of the products of Kali Chemie.\\nThe firm of T. T. Krishnamachari & Sons approached appellant No. 2 for the grant of sole selling, agency of the products of the plant to be established in collaboration with Kali Chemie.\\nAppellant No. 2 did not agree to this with the result that the company 's negotiations with Kali Chemie broke down.\\nThe appellants also say that T. T. Krishnamachari & Sonswere later a so granted a licence to set up a plant for manufacturing barium chemicals but that on appellant No. 2 bringing certainfacts: to the notice of Mr. Nehru the licence in favour of T. T. Krishnamachari & Sons was revoked.\\nThe relevance of these facts is in connection with the plea of mala fides.\\nOn this part of the case the appellant 's contention is that the Chairman of the Company Law Board Mr. R. C. Dutt made the order for investigation into the affairs of appellant No. 1 at the instance of Mr. T. T. Krishnamachari, the then Finance Minister and also because of his bias against appellant No. 2.\\nThe suggestion is that as the licence of M/s. T. T. Krishnamachari & Sons was revoked and as they were not even given sole selling agency for the sale of the products of barium chemicals Mr. T. T. Krishnaniachari wanted action to be taken under this provision either for penalising appellant No. 1 or putting pressure on it.\\n320 A lengthy argument was addressed before us by Mr. Setalvad bearing on the question of mala fides in the course of which he referred us to certain documents.\\nHe also wanted us to bear in mind the sequence in which certain events occurred and said that these would indicate that the former Finance Minister must have been instrumental in having an order under section 237(b) made by the Chairman of the Board.\\nWe were, however, not impressed by this argument.\\nOur learned brother Shelat has dealt with this aspect of the matter fully in his judgment and as we agree with him it is not necessary to say much on the point.\\nWe would, however, like to refer to and deal with one aspect of the argument bearing on the question of mala fides.\\nMr. Setalvad points out that the Company Law Board had decided in December 1964 to take action against appellant No. I under section 237(b) and had actually obtained approval of Mr. T. T. Krishnamachari to the proposed action.\\nTherefore, according to him the real order is of Mr. Krishnamachari even though the order is expressed in the name of the Board.\\nWe find no substance in the argument.\\nThe decision to take action was already taken by the Chairman and there is nothing to indicate that in arriving at that decision he was influenced by the Finance Minister.\\nIf the decision arrived at by the Chairman was an independent one it cannot be said to have been rendered mala fide because it was later approved by Mr. Krishnamachari whose sons undoubtedly constitute the partnership firm of M/s. T. T. Krishnamachari & Sons.\\nIt is also suggested by Mr. Setalvad that the action approved of in December, 1964 was delayed till May, 1965 because in the interval some negotiations with Kali Chemie had been started and had they ended fruitfully M/s. T.T. Krishnamachari & Sons would have got the sole selling agency of the products of barium chemicals.\\nNow it does seem from ,certain material brought to our notice that negotiations with Kali Chemie were revived by appellant No. 2 because of the difficulties which were being experienced in the working of the collaboration agreement with M/s. L. A. Mitchell Ltd. No material, however, is placed before us from which it could be reasonably inferred that had the negotiations with Kali Chemie fructified M/s. T. T. Krishnamachari & Sons would have secured the sole monopoly for sale of the products of barium chemicals.\\nOne more point was urged in connection with this aspect of the argument and it is that the appellants were not given an opportunity to cross examine Mr. T. T. Krishnamachari and Mr. Dutt.\\nIn our opinion, in a proceedingunder article 226 of the Constitution the normal rule is, as pointedout by this Court in The State of Bombay vs Purshottam Jog Naik to decide disputed questions on the basis of affidavits and that it is within the discretion of the High Court whether to allow a person who has sworn an affidavit before it as indeed Mr. Krishnamachari and Mr. Dutt have to be cross examined or not to permit it.\\nIn exercise of.\\nits discretion the High Court has re 321 fused permission to cross examine them.\\nIn such a case it would not be appropriate for this Court while hearing an appeal by special leave to interfere lightly with the exercise of that discretion.\\nMr. Setalvad said that as the appellants had made out a prima facie case of mala fides in their affidavits, and as these allegations had been denied by the respondents, the High Court was in error in refusing permission to the appellants to cross examine the persons who swore the affidavits on the side of the respondents.\\nWe are not aware of the rule on which Mr. Setalvad bases himself.\\nThere is nothing to show that the High Court thought that a prima facie case of mala fides had been made out.\\nEven in such a case a court might well hold that it has been demolished by the affidavits in answer.\\nThe court has to find the facts and if it finds that it can do so without cross examination it is not compelled to permit cross examination.\\nWe have no reason to think that the High Court could not have ascertained the facts on the affidavits themselves.\\nComing to the second point, it would be desirable to repro duce section 237 which reads thus: \\\"Without prejudice to its powers under section 235 the Central Government (a) shall appoint one or more competent persons as inspectors to investigate the affairs of a company and to report thereon in such manner as the Central Government may direct, if (i) the company, by special resolution, or (ii) the Court, by order, declares that the affairs of the company ought to be investigated by an inspector appointed by the Central Government; and (b) may do so if, in the opinion of the Central Government, there are circumstances suggesting (i) that the business of the company is being conducted with intent to defraud its creditors, members or any other persons, or otherwise for a fraudulent or unlawful purpose, or in a manner oppressive of any of its members, or that the company was formed for any fraudulent or unlawful purpose; or (ii) that persons concerned in the formation of the company or the management of its affairs have in connection therewith been guilty of fraud, misfeasance or other misconduct towards the company or towards any of its members; or (iii) that the members of the company have not been given all the information with respect to its 322 affairs.\\nwhich they might reasonably expect, including information relating to the calculation of the commission payable to a managing or other director, the managing agent, the secretaries and treasurers, or the manager of the company.\\n\\\" In view of the fact that the Central Government, by virtue of the powers conferred by sections 10 E and 637 delegated its powers under section 237 to them Company Law Board we shall read section 237 as if in place of the words \\\"Central Government\\\" there are the words \\\"Company Law Board\\\" or for brevity 'Board '.\\nAccording to Mr. Setalvad, cl.\\n(b) of section 237 requires two things: (1) the opinion of the Board and (2) the existence of circumstances suggesting one or more of the matters.\\nspecified in sub cls.\\n(i) to (iii).\\nHe contends that though the opinion of the Board is subjective the existence of circumstances set out in the sub cls.\\n(i) to (iii) is a condition precedent to the formation of the opinion.\\nTherefore, according to him, the Court is entitled to ascertain whether in fact any of those circumstances exists.\\nThe Attorney General disputes this construction and contends that the clause is incapable of a dichotomy and that the subjective process embraces the formation of an opinion that circumstances suggestive of any of the matters comprised in sub cls.\\n(i) to (iii) exist.\\nOnce it is conceded that the formation of an opinion by the Board is intended to be subjective and if the provision is constitutional which in our view it is the question would arise: what is that about which the Board is entitled to form an opinion? The opinion must necessarily concern the existence or non existence of facts suggesting the things mentioned in the several sub clauses of cl.\\nAn examination of the section would show that cl.\\n(b) thereof confers, a discretion upon the Board to appoint an Inspector to investigate the affairs of a company.\\nThe words \\\"in the opinion of\\\" govern the words \\\"there are circumstances suggesting\\\" and not the words \\\"may do so\\\".\\nThe words 'circumstances ' and 'suggesting ' cannot be dissociated without making it impossible for the Board to form an 'opinion ' at all.\\nThe formation of an opinion must, therefore, be as to whether there are circumstances suggesting the existence of one or more of the matters in sub cls.\\n(D to (iii) and not about any thing else.\\nThe opinion must of course not have been arrived at mala fide.\\nTo say that the opinion to be formed must be as to the necessity of making an investigation would be making a clear departure from the language in which section 237(b) is couched.\\nIt is only after the, formation of, certain opinion by the Board that the stage for exercising the discretion conferred by the provision is reached.\\nThe discretion conferred to order an investigation is administrative and not judicial since 323 its exercise one way or the other does not affect the rights of a company nor does it lead to any serious consequences as, for instance, hampering the business of the company.\\nAs has been pointed out by this Court in Raja Narayanalal Bansilal vs Maneck Phiroz Mistry & Anr.(1) the investigation undertaken under this provision is for ascertaining facts and is thus merely exploratory.\\nThe scope for judicial review of the action of the Board must, therefore, be strictly limited.\\nNow, if it can be shown that the 'Board had in fact not formed an opinion its order could be successfully challenged.\\nThis is what was said by the Federal Court in Emperor vs Shibnath Banerjee(2) and approved later by the Privy Council.\\nQuite obviously there is a difference between not forming an opinion at all and forming an opinion upon grounds, which, if a court could go into that question at all, could be regarded as inapt or insufficient or irrelevant.\\nIt is not disputed that a court can,not go into the question of the aptness or sufficiency of the grounds ,upon which the subjective satisfaction of an authority is based.\\nBut, Mr. Setalvad says, since the grounds have in fact been disclosed in the affidavit of Mr. Dutt upon which his subjective satisfaction was based it is open to the court to consider whether those grounds are relevant or are irrelevant because they are extraneous to the question as to the existence or otherwise of any of the matters referred to in sub cls.\\n(i) to (iii).\\nLet us now examine the affidavit of Mr. Dutt.\\nSince this affidavit is in answer to the allegations made in the writ petition the two ;should be considered together.\\nIn paragraphs 1 to 19 of the writ petition certain facts and figures concerning the formation, registration etc.\\nof the company, the activities of the company and other related matters have been set out.\\nThese were admitted by Mr. Dutt in paragraph 14 of the counter affidavit.\\nParagraph 20 onwards of the writ petition deals with the action taken by the Board and the various grounds on which according to the appellants the action of the Board is open to challenge.\\nThe first 4 paragraphs of the counter affidavit deal with certain formal matters.\\nIn paragraph 5 Mr. Dutt has set out that the petition is liable to be dismissed summarily being grounded on facts which are, false, speculative and lacking in material particulars.\\nThereafter he has set out what, according to him, are the true facts.\\nIn paragraphs 6 to 8 he has dealt with the legal aspects of the case.\\nThe 8th paragraph is the most important amongst them.\\nHere Mr. Dutt has stated that it was not competent to the Court to go into the question of adequacy or otherwise of the material on the basis of which orders under section 237(b) are passed by the Board.\\nThen he stated: 'However, if in spite of what has been stated and contrary to the submissions above, this Han 'ble Court still holds that it is necessary for the Court to examine the relevant material in (1)[1961] I S.C.R. 417.\\n(2)[1944] F.C.R. 1.\\n324 order to do justice, then the Board would have no objection to producing the same for the Court 's perusal provided it is not shown to the petitioners.\\n\\\" It may be mentioned that the Court did not call for this material at all nor did the appellants seek its production.\\nIn paragraph 9 Mr. Dutt has categorically stated that the order of May 19, 1965 was passed after careful and independent examination of the material by the Chairman and that it was issued in proper exercise of the powers conferred upon it.\\nHe has specifically denied that it was issued at the instance of the second respondent.\\nIn paragraph 10 Mr. Dutt has taken the plea that the petition was liable to be dismissed as it had not been made bona fide but for extraneous reasons and to create prejudice with a view to thwart statutory investigation.\\nThen he has set out the circumstances upon which his contention is based.\\nIn paragraph 13 he has stated that without prejudice to his submissions in the earlier paragraphs he would reply to allegations contained in the various paragraphs of the writ petition.\\nThen follows paragraph 14 upon which Mr. Setalvad has founded an argument that the grounds disclosed therein being extraneous the order is invalid.\\nIn this paragraph Mr. Dutt has admitted some of the facts stated in paragraphs 1 to 19.\\nHe has also said that the Board was aware of the fact that the company had entered into collaboration with M/s. L. A. Mitchell Ltd. He has then added:. . but it has no information of any of the other matters and/or negotiations with M/s. L. A. Mitchell Ltd., Manchester.\\nHowever, from the Memoranda received by the Board referred to in paragraph 5 and other examination it appeared inter alia that: (i) that there had been delay, bungling and faulty planning of this project, resulting in double expenditure.\\nfor which the 'collaborators had put the responsibility upon the Managing Director, Petitioner No. 2: (ii) Since its flotation the company has been continuously showing losses and nearly 1/3rd of its share capital has been wiped off; (iii)that the shares of the company which to start with were at a premium were being quoted on the Stock Exchange at half their face value; and (iv)some eminent persons who had initially accepted seats on the Board of Directors of the company had subsequently severed their connections with it due to differences with Petitioner No. 2 on account of the manner in which the affairs of the company were being conducted.\\n\\\" In paragraph 5 it may be recalled Mr. Dutt has set out the grounds on which the writ petition deserved to be summarily 325 rejected.\\nIt will thus be clear that what are characterised by Mr. Setalvad as the grounds upon which the order of the Board is based are nothing more than certain conclusions drawn by the Boar& from some of the material which it had before it.\\nMoreover the expression \\\"inter alia\\\" used by Mr. Dutt would show that the conclusions set out by him specifically are not the only ones which could be drawn from the material referred to by, him in paragraph 5 of his affidavit.\\nTurning to paragraph 16 of the affidavit we find that Mr. Dutt has clearly reiterated that there was ample material before the Board on which it could and did form the opinion that there were circumstances suggesting that as stated in the order of May, 19, 1965, the business of the company was being conducted with intent to defraud creditors, members and other persons and further that the persons concerned in the management of the affairs of the company had in connection therewith been guilty of fraud, misfeasance and other misconduct towards the company and its members.\\nThis paragraph is in answer to paragraph 21 of the writ petition.\\nIt is in that paragraph alone that the appellants had specifically raised the contention that the recital in the order as to the existence of material is not correct and that in point of fact there was no material before the Board to form the said opinion.\\nIn this state of pleadings it would not be right to construe the affidavit of Mr. Dutt to mean that the only conclusions emerging from the material before the Board are those that are set out in paragraph 14 of his affidavit.\\nApart from this we do not think that the conclusions set out in paragraph 14 are extraneous to the matters indicated in the order of May 19, 1965.\\nWhat is said therein is that there are circumstances suggesting that the business of the appellants is being conducted with intent to defraud its creditors, members and others, and that.\\nthe persons concerned with the management of the affairs of the company have been guilty of fraud, misfeasance and other misconduct towards the company and its members.\\nit has to be borne in mind that what the Board is to be satisfied about is whether the circumstances suggest any of these things and not whether they establish any of these things.\\nNow, the first of its conclusion is to the effect that the materials show that there was delay , bungling, faulty planning of the project and that this resulted in double expenditure for which the collaborators had put the responsibility upon the Managing Director, that is, appellant No. 2.\\nWould it be farfetched to say that these circumstances could reasonably suggest to the Board that these happenings were not just pieces of careless conduct but were deliberate acts or omissions of appellant No. 2 done with the ulterior motive of earning profit for himself ? Similarly could not the fact that the company was continuously showing losses since its flotation and that 1/ 3rd of its 326 share : capital had ,been wiped out could have been suggestive of fraud to the Board.\\nIn 'this connection, we think it right to point out that the spirit of the section must be kept in mind in determining its interpretation.\\nThe section was enacted to prevent the Management of a company from acting in a manner prejudicial to the interests of the shareholders for whom it was difficult,to get together and take steps for the protection of their interests jointly.\\nIt was this difculty of the shareholders which is a reality which had led to the enactment of the section.\\nThere is no doubt that few share holders have the means or ability to act against the Management.\\nIt would furthermore be difficult for the shareholders to find out the facts leading to the poor financial condition of a company.\\nThe Government thought it right to take power to step in where there was reason to suspect that the Management may not have been acting in the interests of the shareholders who would not be able to take the steps against a powerful body like the Managementand to take steps for protection of such interests.\\nAs we have said, the section gives the exploratory power only.\\nIts object is to find out the facts.\\n, a suspicion having been entertained that all was not well with the company.\\nThe powers are exercised for ascertaining facts and, therefore, before they are finally known, all that is necessary for the exercise of the powers is the opinion ,of the Board that there are circumstances which suggest to it that fraud and other kinds of mismanagement mentioned in sub cls.\\n(i) to (iii) of cl.\\n(b) of the section may have been committed.\\nIf the facts do reasonably suggest any of these things to the Board, the power can be exercised,though another.\\nindividual might think that : the ;facts suggest otherwise It cannot be said that from a huge loss incurred by a company and the working of the company in a disorganised and un businegslike way, the only conclusion possible is that it was due to lack of capability.\\nIt is reasonably ,conceivable that the result had been produced by fraud and other varieties of dishonesty or misfeasance.\\nThe order does not amount to a finding of fraud.\\nIt is to find out what kind of wrong ,action has led to,the company 's ill fate that the powers under the sectional given.\\nThe enquiry may reveal that.the renovation or other similar kind of malfeasance.\\nIt would be destroying the beneficial effective use of the powers given by the section to say that the Board must first show that a fraud can clearly be said to have.been committed.\\nIt is enough that the facts show that it can be reasonably thought that the company 's unfortunate position might have been caused by fraud and other species of dishonest action.\\nIn our opinion, therefore, the argument of Mr. Setalvad about the circumstances being extraneous cannot be accepted.\\nComing to the third point of Mr. Setalvad pointed out that four ex Directors of the Company who had resigned submitted a 327 memorandum to Mr. T. T. Krishnamachari while he was holding the office of Finance Minister in which grave allegations were made concerning the affairs of the Company and the management of the Company by the second appellant.\\nThe investigation, according to Mr. Setalvad.\\nwas the outcome of this memorandum and that by ordering it the Board has in effect enabled the ex Directors who continue to be shareholders to circumvent the provisions of sections 235 and 236 of the .\\nSection 235 deals with \\\"Investigation of affairs of company on application by members or report by Registrar\\\".\\nClause (a) of this section provides that in the case of a company having a share capital the investigation can be ordered either on the application of not less than 200 members or of members holding not less than one tenth of the total voting power therein.\\nWe are not concerned with cls.\\n(b) and (c).\\nApparently the four ex Directors were not holding 10% of the voting power of the Company.\\nAt any rate the case was argued on this footing.\\nSection 236 provides that such application has to be supported by such evidence as the Board (reading 'Board ' for 'Central Government ') may require.\\nIt also empowers the Board to require the applicants to furnish security for such amount, not exceeding one thousand rupees as it may think fit, for the payment of the costs of the investigation.\\nThe contention is that though the Board acted upon the memorandum submitted by four ex Directors it did not even require them to comply with the provisions of section 236.\\nThe contention is that the order of the Board appointing Inspectors is invalid.\\nIn other words the argument amounts to this that the provisions of section 237(b) have been utilised by the Board as a cloak for taking action under the provisions of section 235.\\nIn other words this is an argument that the order was made mala fide.\\nIt is true that a memorandum was presented to Mr. Krishna machari by four ex Directors containing grave allegations against the two appellants.\\nBut it was not solely on the basis of this memorandum that action was taken by the Board.\\nIt is clear from the counter affidavit of Mr. Dutt and particularly from paragraph 5 thereof that the Board had before it not only two sets of memoranda dated May 30, 1964 and July 9, 1964 respectively from four ex Directors of the Company alleging serious irregularities and illegalities in the conduct of the affairs of the Company but also other materials.\\nThe Board points out that over a long period beginning from September 1961 the Department had been receiving various complaints in regard to the conduct of the affairs of the Company.\\nOne complaint had also been received by the Special Police Establishment and forwarded by it to the Department in November, 1963.\\nThe matter was enquired into by the Regional Director of the Board at Madras and he, in his report, sent to the Board in September 1964 suggested an urgent and comprehensive investigation into the affairs of the Company.\\nIn his /S5SCI 23 328 affidavit the Chairman of the Board Mr. Dutt has stated further in paragraph 5(b) as follows: \\\"The material on the file was further examined in the light of the Regional Director 's recommendation by the two Under Secretaries of the Board (Sarvashri M. K. Banerjee C. section section and K. C. Chand, I. R. section at the head.\\nquarters of the Board in New Delhi and both of them endorsed the recommendation of the Regional Director to order an investigation.\\nThe matter was then considered by the Secretary of the Company Law Board in charge of investigation (Shri D. section Dang, I.A.S.) and he also expressed his agreement that there was need for a deeper probe into the affairs of the company.\\n\\\" Then again in paragraph 5(c) he has stated as follows: \\\"Accordingly, the matter was put up to me at the end of November 1964 and after consideration of all the material on record, I formed the opinion that there were circumstances suggesting the need for action under section 237(b) of the \\\".\\nIt is abundantly clear from all this that the investigation cannot be said to have been ordered either at the instance of the four ex Directors or on the sole basis of the memoranda submitted by them.\\nThere is, therefore, no contravention of the provisions of SS. 235 and 236 of the Act.\\nAs a corollary to this it would follow that the order was not made mala fide or is otherwise invalid.\\nAs already stated the appellant had challenged the provisions of section 237(b) on the ground that they are violative of the fundamental rights under articles 14 and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution.\\nOur brother Shelat has dealt with this attack on the provisions fully and we agree generally with what he has said while dealing with the contentions.\\nWe would, however, like to add that the com pany being an artificial legal person cannot, as held by this Court in The State Trading Corporation of India Ltd., vs Commercial Tax Officer Visakhapatnam & Ors.(1),claim the benefit of the provisions of article 19(1)(g) though appellant No. 2 Balasubramanian can do so.\\nWe agree with our learned brother that the action proposed under section 237(b) being merely, exploratory in character the fundamental right of Balasubramanian to carry on business is not affected thereby.\\nSince that is so, the question whether the pro visions of the aforesaid section are a reasonable restriction on the exercise of the right under article 19(1)(g) does not arise for consideration.\\nIn the circumstances, therefore, we do not think that there is anything more that we need say.\\nThe last question is whether it was not competent to Mr. Dutt alone to take the decision that an investigation be ordered against the company.\\nIn taking the decision Mr. Dutt acted under a rule 1964] 4 S.C.R. 99. 329 of procedure prescribed in the order dated February 6, 1964.\\nThe validity of this rule is challenged, by Mr. Setalvad on the ground that this amounts to sub delegation of a delegated power and is ultra vires the Act.\\nClause (a) of sub section\\n(1) of section 637 read with section 10(E)(1) empower the Central Government to delegate its powers under section 237 to the Company Law Board.\\nBy notification dated February 1, 1964 the Central Government has delegated, amongst other powers and functions, those conferred upon it by section 237 upon the Company Law Board.\\nBy another notification of the same date the Central Government has made and published rules made by it in exercise of its powers under section 642(1) read with section 10E(5) rule 3 of which reads thus: \\\"Distribution of business; The Chairman may, with the previous approval of the Central Government, by order in writing, distribute the business of the Board, among himself and the other member or members, and specify the cases or classes of cases which shall be considered jointly by the Board.\\n\\\" By order dated February 6, 1964 the Chairman of the Company Law Board specified the cases and classes of cases to be considered jointly by the Board and distributed the remaining business between himself and other members of the Board.\\nAmongst the matters allocated to the Chairman is the appointment of an Inspector under section 237 to investigate the affairs of a company.\\nThis, Mr. Setalvad says\\\" could not be done in the absence of an express provision in the Act.\\nIn this connection he has referred us to sub section\\n4A of section 10E which was subsequently added but not made retrospective by an amendment of the Act which confers an express power on the Central Government to enable the Chairman to distribute the powers and functions of the Board.\\nAccording to the learned Attorney General this provision was enacted only to make what was implicit in section 10E(5) read with section 642(1) clear and that the distribution of the work of the Board being merely a matter of procedure the order of the Chairman allocating the power under section 237(b) to himself did not amount to sub delegation of the power of the Board.\\nBearing in mind the fact that the power conferred by section 237(b) is merely administrative it is difficult to appreciate how the allocation of business of the Board relating to the exercise of such power can be anything other than a matter of procedure.\\nStrictly speaking the Chairman to whom the business of the Board is allocated does not become a delegate of the Board at all.\\nHe acts in the name of the Board and is no more than its agent But even if he is looked upon as a delegate of the Board and, therefore, a sub delegate vis a vis the Central Government he would be as much subject to the control of the Central Government as the Board itself.\\nFor sub section\\n(6) of section 10E provides that the Board shall, in S5SCI 23(a) 330 the exercise of the powers delegated to it, be subject to the control of the Central Government and the order distributing the business was made with the permission of the Central Government.\\nBearing in mind that the maxim delegatus non potest delegare sets out what is merely a rule of construction, sub delegation can be sustained if permitted by an express provision or by necessary impli cation.\\nWhere, as here, what is sub delegated is an administrative power and control over its exercise is retained by the nominee of Parliament, that is, here the Central Government, the power to make a delegation may be inferred.\\nWe are, therefore, of the view that the order made by the Chairman on behalf of the Board is not invalid.\\nTo sum up, then, our conclusions may be stated thus: The discretion conferred on the Central Government by section 237(b) to order an investigation and delegated by it to the Company Law Board is administrative, that it could be validly exercised by the Chairman of the Board by an order made in pursuance of a rule enacted by the Central Government under section 642(1) read with section 10E(5), that the exercise of the power does not violate any fundamental right of the company, that the opinion to be formed under section 237(b) is subjective and that if the grounds are disclosed by the Board the Court can examine them for considering whether they are relevant.\\nIn the case before us they appear to be relevant in the context of the matter mentioned in sub cls.\\n(i) to (iii) of section 237(b).\\nThough the order could successfully be challenged if it were made mala fide, it has not been shown to have been so made.\\nThe attack on the order thus fails and the appeal is dismissed with costs.\\nHidayatullah, J. We are concerned in this appeal with the legality of an order of the Chairman, Company Law Board, May 19, 1965, (purporting to be under section 237(b) of the ) declaring that the affairs of the Barium Chemicals Ltd. be investigated.\\nAs a consequence Inspectors have been appointed and searches have been made.\\nThe Company and its Managing Director filed a petition under article 226 of the Constitution in the High Court of Punjab seeking to quash the order and on failure there, have filed this appeal by special leave of this Court.\\nThe action of the Chairman was and is challenged on diverse grounds but those which were presented before us were few and clear cut.\\nThe action is challenged as without jurisdiction because not the Board but the Chairman alone acted, as mala fide because no honest opinion was formed on the matters which under the section give rise to the power but on irrelevant and extraneous material, and further because the order was passed under the influence and malice of a Minister of Cabinet who was interested in another Company belonging to his sons and sought this means to oust a rival.\\nThe facts have been stated already in some detail by my brother Shelat and I need not take time in restating them.\\nMy 331 order proposed by him but as I view the matter a little differently on some of the aspects of the case, I wish to record my reasons briefly.\\nUnder the , a power of superintendence over the affairs of Companies is retained by the Central Government in much the same way as the Board of Trade in England exercise over Companies in that country.\\nThis power is of two kinds (a) calling for information or explanation from the Company and (b) ordering an investigation into the affairs of the Company by appointment of Inspectors for inspection, investigation and report.\\nThe power is not only varied but is capable of being exercised variously.\\nThe power to call for information is conferred on the Regisrar in two different ways.\\nFirstly, jurisdiction is conferred on the Registrar by section 234 to call for information or explanation in relation to any document submitted to him, which information or explanation must be furnished on pain of penalties.\\nIf the information or explanation is not furnished or is unsatisfactory the Registrar can report to the Central Government for action.\\nSecondly, if a contributory, creditor 'or other person interested places materials before the Registrar (a) that the business of the Company is being carried on in fraud of its creditors or of persons dealing with the Company or (b) otherwise for a fraudulent or unlawful purpose, the Registrar can, after hearing the Company, call upon it to furnish any information or explanation.\\nA further power is conferred after December 28, 1960, on the Registrar, who may, after being authorised by a Presidency Magistrate or a Magistrate First Class, enter any place, search and seize any document relating to the Company, its managing agents, or Secretaries and treasurers or managing director or manager, if be has reason to believe that it may be destroyed or tampered with.\\nSections 235 251 provide for investigation of the affairs of a company and for sundry matters related to such investigations.\\nThey follow the scheme of sections 164 175 of the English Act of 1948.\\nSection 235 enables the Central Government to appoint inspectors for investigation and report generally if the Registrar reports under section 234 and also if a stated number of shareholders or shareholders possessing a stated voting power apply.\\nWhen ' members apply they must support their application by evidence and give security for costs of investigation.\\nIn the present case no action under any of the sections noted so far was taken but it was taken under section 237.\\nThis section is in two parts.\\nThe first part which is (a) compels the Central Government to appoint inspectors to investigate and report if the company by a special resolution or the court by order declares that the affairs be investigated.\\nThe second part which is (b) gives a discretionary power, As this dis 332 cretionary power was in fact exercised this is a convenient place to read part (b) of section 237.\\nIt reads: \\\"237.\\nWithout prejudice to its powers under section 235, the Central Government (a) (b) may do so (i.e. appoint one or more competent persons as inspectors to investigate etc.) if, in the opinion of the Central Government, there are circumstances suggesting (i) that the business of the company is being conducted with intent to defraud its creditors, members or any other persons, or otherwise for a fraudulent or unlawful purpose, or in a manner oppressive of any of its members, or that the company was formed for any fraudulent or unlawful purpose; (ii) that persons concerned in the formation of the company or the management of its affairs have in connection therewith been guilty of fraud, misfeasance or other misconduct towards the company or towards any of its members; or (iii) that the members of the company have not been given all the information with respect to its affairs which they might reasonably expect, including information relating to the calculation of the commission payable to a managing or other director, the managing agent, the secretaries and treasurers, or the manager, of the company.\\nBy section 237(b) the power is conferred on the Central Government but under the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1963 a Board of Company Law,, Administration consisting of a Chairman and a member has been set up.\\nThis Board is constituted under section 10E which has been introduced in the parent Act.\\nThe section may be read here: \\\"10E. Constitution of Board of Company Law Administration.\\n(1) As soon as may be after the commencement of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1963, the Central Government shall, by notification in the Official Gazette, constitute a Board to be called the Board of Company Law Admin istration to exercise and discharge such powers and functions conferred on the Central Government by or under this Act or any other law as may be delegated to it by that Government.\\n333 (2) The Company Law Board shall consist of such number of members, not exceeding five, as the Central Government deems fit, to be appointed by that Government by notification in the Official Gazette.\\n(3) One of the members shall be appointed by the Central Government to be the chairman of the Company Law Board.\\n(4) No act done by the Company Law Board shall be called in question on the ground only of any defect in the constitution of, or the existence of any vacancy in, the Company Law Board.\\n(5) The procedure of the Company Law Board shall be such as may be prescribed.\\n(6) In the exercise of its powers and discharge of its functions, the Company Law Board shall be subject to the control of the Central Government.\\nThe Board was constituted on February 1, 1964 by a notification and by a notification of even, date in exercise of the powers conferred by cl.\\n(a) of sub section\\n(1) of section 637 read with sub section\\n(1) of section 10E of the , the Central Government delegated its powers and functions to the Board under section 237(b) among others.\\nSimultaneously acting in exercise of the powers conferred by sub section\\n(1) of section 642 read with sub section\\n(5) of section 10E the Central Government made the Company Law Board (Procedure) Rules, 1964 and one such rule dealt with distribution of business to the following effect: \\\"3.\\nDistribution of business The Chairman may, with the previous approval of the Central Government, by order in writing, distribute the business of the Board among himself and the other member or members, and specify the cases or classes of cases which shall be considered jointly by the Board.\\n\\\" The Chairman by an order dated February 6, 1964 specified the cases or classes of cases which are to be considered jointly by the Board and distributed the remaining business of the Board between the Chairman and the member each acting individually.\\nThe power under section 237 was placed among the powers exercisable by the Chairman singly.\\nThat is how action was taken in the name of the Board but by the Chairman and is the subject of challenge for the reason that a power delegated to the Board as a whole cannot be delegated to an individual member in the absence of a provision such as sub section\\n(4A) added recently to section 10E enabling the solidarity of the Board to be broken.\\nSub section (4A) of section 10E, which has been added by an amending Act of 1965, after the events in this case, reads: \\\"10E. (4A).\\nThe Board.\\nwith the previous approval of the Central Government, may, by order in writing, 334 authorise the chairman or any of its other members or its principal officer (whether known as secretary or by any other name) to exercise and discharge, subject to such conditions and limitations, if any, as may be specified in the order, such of its powers and functions as it may think fit; and every order made or act done in the exercise of such powers or discharge of such functions shall be deemed to be the order or act, as the case may be, of the Board.\\n\\\" This sub section enables the work of the Board to be distributed among members while sub section\\n(5) merely enables the procedure of the Board to be regulated.\\nThese are two very different things.\\nOne provides for distribution of work in such a way that each constituent part of the Board properly authorised, becomes the Board.\\nThe other provides for the procedure of the Board.\\nWhat is the Board, is not a question which admits of solution by procedural rules but by the enactment of a substantive provision allowing for a different delegation.\\nSuch an enactment has been framed in relation to the Tribunal constituted under section 10B and has now been framed under section 10E also.\\nThe new sub section involves a delegation of the powers of the Central Government to a member of the Board which the Act previously allowed to be made to the Board only.\\nThe statute, as it was formerly, gave no authority to delegate it differently or to another person or persons.\\nWhen it spoke of procedure in sub section (5) it spoke of the procedure of the Board as constituted.\\nThe lacuna in the Act must have been felt, otherwise there was no need to enact sub section (4A).\\nThe argument of the learned Attorney General that sub section\\n(4A) was ?lot needed at all, does not appeal to me.\\nIt is quite clear that its absence would give rise to the argument accepted by me, which argument is unanswerable in the absence of a provision such as the new sub section.\\nMy brother Shelat has dealt with this aspect of the case fully and I cannot add anything useful to what he has said.\\nI agree with him entirely on this point.\\nI shall now consider the question of mala fides.\\nThis arises in two different ways.\\nThere is first mala fides attributed to the chairman because he is said to have acted under the behest of a Minister of Cabinet interested in another rival Company.\\nIt is not necessary to go into it.\\nThe Chairman obtained the opinion of quite a few of his assistants (perhaps more than was altogether necessary) and this fact is stated to establish his fairness to and honest dealing with the Company.\\nThere is nothing to show that this was done on purpose to cover up a conspiracy to do harm to the Company.\\nOn the other hand I cannot overlook the fact that the rival Company itself had obtained a licence to manufacture Barium Chemicals which it allowed to lapse.\\nThis shows that rivalry between two manufacturing concerns was not the prime 335 motive.\\nNo doubt the rival Company had tried to obtain the sole selling rights of, and even a share in, this Company.\\nThis might have weighed with me but for the fact that the Company itself had done nothing even before action was taken, to establish itself.\\nThe whole project had hung fire and capital was eaten into a rapid rate because there were technical defects in the setting up of the plant and machinery.\\nThere was not much hope of profits as a sole selling agent or even as a partner.\\nIn these circumstances, I cannot go by the allegations made against the Chairman of the Board personally or those made against the Minister, and I find no evidence to hold that dishonesty on the part of the one or malice on the part of the other lies at the root of this action.\\nThis brings me to the third and the last question, namely, whether mala fides or the ultra vires nature of the action has been established in this case to merit interference at our hands.\\nIn view of my decision on the question of delegation it is hardly necessary to decide this question but since contradictory opinions have been expressed on it by my brethren Mudholkar and Shelat.\\nI must give my views on this matter.\\nThe question naturally divides itself into two parts.\\nThe first is whether there was any personal bias, oblique motive or ulterior purpose in the act of the chairman.\\nThe second is what are the powers of the Board in this behalf and whether they have been exercised contrary to the requirements of the Act.\\nThe first ground has already been dealt with in part when I considered the malice and influence of the Minister.\\nIt may be said at once, that apart from that allegation, nothing has been said attributing to the Chairman any personal bias, grudge, oblique motive or ulterior purpose.\\nEven in the arguments it was not suggested that the Chairman acted from improper motives.\\nTherefore, all that I have to consider is whether the action of the Chairman can be challenged as done either contrary to the provisions empowering him or beyond those provisions.\\nIn dealing with this problem the first point to notice is that the power is discretionary and its exercise depends upon the honest formation of an opinion that an investigation is necessary.\\nThe words \\\"in the opinion of the Central Government\\\" indicate that the opinion must be formed by the Central Government and it is of course implicit that the opinion must be an honest opinion.\\nThe next requirement is that \\\"there are circumstances suggesting etc.\\n\\\" These words indicate that before the Central Government forms its opinion it must have before it circumstances suggesting certain inferences.\\nThese inferences are of many kinds and it will be useful to make a mention of them here in a tabular form: (a) that the business is being conducted with intent to defraud (i) creditors of the company, or (ii) members, 336 or (iii) any other person; (b) that the business is being conducted (i) for a fraudulent purpose or (ii) for an unlawful purpose; (c) that persons who formed the company or manage its affairs have been guilty of (i) fraud or (ii) misfeasance or other misconduct to wards the company or towards any of its members.\\n(d) That information has been withheld from the members about its affairs which might reasonably be expected including calculation of commission payable to (i) managing or other director, (ii) managing agent, (iii) the secretaries and treasurers, (iv) the managers.\\nThese grounds limit the jurisdiction of the Central Govern ment.\\nNo jurisdiction, outside the section which empowers the initiation of investigation, can be exercised.\\nAn action, not based on circumstances suggesting an inference of the enumerated kind will not be valid.\\nIn other words, the enumeration of the inferences which may be drawn from the circumstances, postulates the absence of a general discretion to go on a fishing expedition to find evidence.\\nNo doubt the formation of opinion is subjective but the existence of circumstances relevant to the inference as the sine qua non for action must be demonstrable.\\nIf the action is questioned on the ground that no circumstance leading to an inference of the kind contemplated by the section exists, the action might be exposed to interference unless the existence of the circumstances is made out.\\nAs my brother Shelat has put it trenchantly: \\\"It is not reasonable to say that the clause permitted the government to say that it has formed the opinion on circumstances which it thinks exist. . . .\\nSince the existence of \\\"circumstances\\\" is a condition fundamental to the making of an opinion, the existence of the circumstances.\\nif questioned, has to be proved at least prima facie.\\nIt is not sufficient to assert that the circumstances exist and give no clue to what they are because the circumstances must be such as to lead to conclusions of certain definiteness.\\nThe conclusions must relate to an intent to defraud, a fraudulent or unlawful purpose, fraud or misconduct or the withholding of information of a particular kind.\\nWe have to see whether the Chairman in his affidavit has shown the existence of circumstances leading to such tentative 337 conclusions.\\nIf he has, his action cannot be questioned because the in reference is to be drawn subjectively and even if this Court would not have drawn a similar inference that fact would be irrelevant.\\nBut if the circumstances pointed out are such that no inference of the kind stated in section 237(b) can at all be drawn the action would be ultra vires the Act and void.\\nNow the Chairman in his affidavit referred to two memoranda dated May 30, 1964 and July 4, 1964 presented by certain ex directors and also stated that from September 1961 complaints were being received in regard to the conduct of the affairs of the Company, and one such complaint was received from Special Police Establishment in November 1963.\\nThe nature of the complaints was not disclosed but in reference to the memoranda it was stated that \\\"irregularities\\\" and \\\"illegalities\\\" in the conduct of the affairs of the Company was alleged therein.\\nIt was also stated that the memoranda \\\"were supported by documentary evidence and details of the impugned transactions and the signatories offered to produce witnesses with knowledge of these transactions\\\".\\nThis was followed by an enquiry by the Regional Director of the Board at Madras (Shri R. section Ramamurthi, I.A.S.) who made a report in September 1964.\\nThe report was next considered by two Under Secretaries arid by the Secretary of the Company Law board who all agreed \\\"that there was need for a deeper probe into the affairs of the Company\\\".\\nThe matter was then placed before the Chairman who formed the opinion that there were circum stances suggesting the need for action under section 237(b).\\nNone of the reports was produced.\\nNor was there any indication in the affidavit what their drift was.\\nThere was considerable delay in taking up the matter and this was explained as occasioned by the language riots, and other more pressing occupation.\\nIt appears that in the High Court an offer was made to place the reports etc.\\nin the hands of the Court provided they were not shown to the other side, but no such offer was made in this Court.\\nThe High Court did not look into the documents.\\nHad the matter rested there it would have been a question whether this Court should interfere with a subjective opinion, when the affidavit showed that there were materials for consideration.\\nIt would then have been a question whether this Court could or should go behind the affidavit.\\nI leave that question to be decided in another case where it arises.\\nIn this case it is not necessary to decide it because the affidavit goes on to state: \\\". . .\\nHowever from the Memoranda received by the Board referred to in paragraph 5 and other examination it appeared inter alia that: (i) there had been delay, bungling and faulty planning of this project, resulting in double expenditure, for which the collaborators had put the responsibility upon the Managing Director, Petitioner No. 2, 338 (ii) Since its floatation the company has been continuously showing losses and nearly 1/3rd of its share capital has been wiped off; (iii) that the shares of the company which to start with were at a premium were being quoted on the Stock Exchange at half their fa ce value; and (iv) some eminent persons who had initially accepted seats on the Board of directors of the company had subsequently severed their connections with it due to differences with Petitioner No. 2 on account of the manner in which the affairs of the company were being conducted.\\n\\\" Paragraph 14 of the affidavit).\\nIt may be mentioned that in paragraph 16 of the affidavit the Chairman also stated: \\\"With reference to paragraph 21 of the petition, I have already stated above that there was ample material before the Board on which it could and did form the opinion that there were circumstances suggesting that the business of the company was being conducted with intent to defraud its creditors, members and other persons and further that the persons concerned in the management of the affairs of the company had in connection therewith been guilty of fraud, misfeasance and other misconduct towards the company and its members.\\n\\\" The question thus arises what has the Chairman placed before the Court to indicate that his action was within the four corners of his own powers? Here it must be noticed that members are ordinarily expected to take recourse to the Registrar because there they have to be in a certain number or command a certain proportion of the voting power.\\nThey are also required to give evidence and the Company gets an opportunity to explain its actions.\\nIf section 237(b) is used by members, as an alternative to section 236, the evidence must unerringly point to the grounds on which alone action can be founded.\\nIn my opinion there is nothing to show that the, reports which were being received from September 1961, or the report of the Special Police Establishment indicated fraud.\\nillegality or action or actions with intent to defraud, as contemplated by the section.\\nThe affidavit merely says that these reports indicated the need for a deeper probe.\\nThis is not sufficient.\\nThe material must suggest certain inferences and not the need for \\\"a deeper probe\\\".\\nThe former is a definite conclusion the latter a mere fishing expedition.\\nA straight forward affidavit that there were circumstances suggesting any of these inferences was at least necessary.\\nThere is no such affidavit and the reason is that the Chairman completely misunderstood his own powers.\\nThis is indicated by the enumeration of the four circumstances, I have extracted from his affidavit and I proceed to analyse them.\\n339 The first circumstance is \\\"delay, bungling and faulty plan ning\\\" resulting in \\\"double expenditure\\\" for which the collaborators had put the responsibility on the second appellant.\\nNone of these shows an intent to defraud by which phrase is meant something to induce another to act to his disadvantage.\\nThe circumstances mentioned show mismanagement and inefficiency which is not the same thing as fraud or misconduct.\\nThe second and the third circumstance merely establish that there was loss in making this project work and that a part of capital had been lost.\\nThis was admitted by the appellants who pointed out that after considerable negotiations they induced Lord Poole, the President of the collaborating firm, to invest a further sum of pound 25,000.\\nThis shows that the appellants were in a position to dictate to the collaborating company which they would not have been able to do if they were guilty of fraudulent conduct.\\nThe last circumstance does not also bear upon the subject of fraud and acts done with intend to defraud.\\nthat some directors have resigned does not establish fraud or misconduct.\\nThere may be other reasons for the resignation.\\nIn the other part of the affidavit the Chairman has merely repeated section 237(b) but has not stated how he came to the conclusion and on what material.\\nIn other words, he has not disclosed anything from which it can be said that the inference which he has drawn that the Company was being conducted with intent to defraud its creditors, members and other persons or persons concerned in the management of the affairs of the Company were guilty of fraud, misfeasance and misconduct towards the company and its members was based on circumstances present before him.\\nIn fact, paragraph 16 is no more than a mechanical repetition of the words of the section.\\nComing now to the affidavit of Mr. Dang I find that he merely repeats what was stated in the affidavit of the Chairman.\\nHe also said that he had seen the papers and agreed with his two Under Secretaries and the Regional Director that a \\\"deeper probe\\\" was necessary ' There is no hint even in this affidavit that the circumstances were such as to suggest fraud, intent to defraud or misconduct, this is to say, circumstances under which investigation can be ordered.\\nThe other affidavits also run the same way and it is not, therefore, necessary to refer to them.\\nWe are concerned really with the affidavits of the Chairman and Mr. Dang in relation to the exercise of the power conferred by section 237(b).\\nNeither proves the existence of circumstances under which the power could be exercised.\\nIn my opinion, therefore, the action has not been proved to be justified.\\nNo doubt, the section confers a discretion but it sets its own limits upon the discretion by stating clearly what must be looked for in the shape of evidence before the drastic act of investigation into the affairs of a company can be taken.\\nThe affidavits which were filed in answer to the petition do not disclose 340 even the prima facie existence of these circumstances.\\nOn the other hand, they emphasise only that there was mismanagement and losses which necessitated a \\\"deeper probe\\\".\\nIn other words, the act of the Chairman was in the nature of, a fishing expedition and not after satisfaction that the affairs of the Company were being carried on even prima facie with the intent to defraud or that the persons incharge were guilty of fraud or other misconduct.\\nAs to the constitutionality of section 237(b) I agree with my brethren Bachawat and Shelat and have nothing to add.\\n1, therefore.\\nagree with my brother Shelat that the appeal must be allowed.\\nThere will be no order about costs.\\nBachawat, J.\\nThe order dated May 19, 1965 was passed by the Chairman of the Company Law Board Mr. Setalvad submitted that only the Board could pass an order under section 237, the Central Government could delegate its function under section 237 to the Board but it had no power to authorise the Chairman to sub delegate this function to himself and consequently, the Company Law Board (Procedure) Rules, 1964 made by the Central Government on February 1, 1964 and the Chairman 's order of distribution of business dated February 6, 1964 delegating the function of the Board under section 237 to the Chairman are ultra vires the and the impugned order is invalid.\\nThe learned Attorney General disputed these submissions.\\nAs a general rule, whatever a person has power to do himself, he may do by means of an agent.\\nThis broad rule is limited by the operation of the principle that a delegated authority cannot be redelegate, delegates non protest delegate.\\nThe naming of I delegate to, do an act involving a discretion indicates that the delegate was selected because of his peculiar skill and the confidence reposed in him, and there is a presumption that he is required to do the act himself and cannot redelegate his authority.\\nAs a general rule, \\\"if the, statute directs that certain acts shall be done in a specified manner or by certain persons, their performance in any other manner than that specified or by any other person than one of those name is impliedly prohibited.\\n\\\" See Crawford on statutory Construction, 1940 Edn., article 195, p. 335: Normally, a discretion entrusted by Parliament to an administrative organ must be exercised by.\\nthat organ itself.\\nIf a statute entrusts an administrative function involving the exercise of a discretion to a Board consisting of two or more persons it is to be presumed that each member of the Board should exercise his individual judgment on the matter and all, the members of the Board should act together and arrive at a joint decision.\\nPrima facie, the Board must act as a whole and cannot delegate its function to one of its members.\\nThe learned Attorney General submitted that a distribution of business among the members of the Company Law Board is not a delegation of its authority, and the maxim has no application in 341 such a case.\\nI cannot accept this submission.\\nIn Cook vs Ward(1), the Court held that where a drainage board constituted by an Act of Parliament was authorised by it to delegate its powers to a committee, the powers so delegated to the committee must be exercised by them acting in concert and it was not competent to them to apportion those powers amongst themselves and one of them acting, alone, pursuant to such apportionment, could not justify his acts under the statute.\\nLord Coleridge, C. J. said at p. 262: \\\"It was not competent to them to delegate powers, which required the united action of the three, to be exercised according to the unaided judgment of one of them.\\\" Again, in Vine vs National Dock Labour Board(1), the House of Lords, held that a local board set up, under the scheme embodied in the schedule to the Dock Workers (Regulation of Employment) Order, 1947 had no power to assign its disciplinary function under cls.\\n15(4) and 16(2) of the scheme to a committee and the purported dismissal of a worker by the committee was a nullity.\\nIn my opinion, the distribution of the business of the Board among its members is a delegation of its authority.\\nBut the maxim \\\"delegatus non potest delegare\\\" must not be pushed too far.\\nThe maxim does not embody a rule of law.\\nIt indicates a rule of construction of a statute or other instrument conferring an authority.\\nPrima facie, a discretion conferred by a statute, on any authority is intended to be exercised by that authority, and.\\nby no other.\\nBut the intention may be negatived by any contrary indications in the language, scope or object of the statute.\\nThe construction that would best achieve the purpose and object of the statute should be adopted.\\nUnder sections 10E(1) and 637(1)(a), the Central Government has power to constitute a Company, Law Board and to delegate its functions to the Board.\\nThe Board can consist of such number of persons not exceeding five as the Government thinks fit.\\nOne of the members of the Board has to be appointed a Chairman and this necessarily implies that the Board shall consist of at least two members.\\nAs a matter of fact, the Government constituted a Board consisting of two members and appointed one of them as Chairman.\\nTo this Board the Government delegated its function under section 237.\\nSection 637 shows that the function under section 237 can be delegated to the Board and to no other authority.\\nThe function under section 237(b) involves the exercise of a discretion.\\nPrima facie, all the members of the Board acting together were required to discharge this function and they could not delegate their duty to the Chairman.\\nHowever, under sections 10E(5) and 642(1), the Central Government may frame rules regulating the procedure of the Board and generally to carry out the purposes of the Act.\\nIn the context of section 10E, I am inclined to construe this rule making power liberally The Central Government has power to constitute the Company Law Board, to delegate its functions to the Board and to control (1) (2) 342 the Board in the exercise of its delegated functions.\\nIn this background, by conferring on the Central Government the additional power of framing rules regulating the procedure of the Board and generally to carry out the purposes of section 10E, the Parliament must have intended that the internal Organisation of the Board and the mode and manner of transacting its business should be regulated entirely by rules framed by the Government.\\nThe Government had, therefore, power to frame the Company Law Board (Procedure) Rules, 1964 authorising the Chairman to distribute the business of the Board.\\nIn the exercise of the power conferred by this rule, the Chairman assigned the business under section 237 to himself.\\nThe Chairman alone could, therefore, pass the impugned order.\\nAct No. 31 of 1965 has now inserted sub section\\n(4A) in section 10E authorising the Board to delegate its powers and functions to its Chairman or other members or principal officer.\\nThe power under sub section\\n(4A) may be exercised by the Board independently of any rules framed by the Central Government.\\nWe find, however, that the Central Government had under sections 10E(5) and 642(1) ample power to frame rules authorising the Chairman to distribute the business of the Board.\\nThe wide ambit of this rule making power is not cut down by the subsequent insertion of sub section\\n(4A) in section 10E. Sections 235, 237(a) and 237(b) enable the Central Govern ment to make an order appointing an inspector to investigate the affairs of a company in different sets of circumstances, and the contention that section 237(b) is discriminatory and is violative of article 14 must fail.\\nI also think that section 237(b) is not violative of articles 19(1)(f) and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution.\\nThe company is not a citizen and has no fundamental right under article 19.\\nAppellant No. 2 who is the managing director of the company is not a citizen, but even assuming that section 237(b) imposes restrictions on his right of property or his right to carry on his occupation as managing director, those restrictions are reasonable and are imposed in the interests of the general public.\\nOn the question of mala fides, I am inclined to think that the Chairman passed the order dated May 19, 1965 independently of and without any pressure from the Minister.\\nI am all the more persuaded to come to this conclusion having regard to the fact that in paragraph 14 of his affidavit the Chairman has disclosed the circumstances which he took into account in passing the order.\\nIn paragraphs 5, 8 and 16 of his affidavit, the Chairman stated that he had various materials on the basis of which he passed the order.\\nBut, on reading this affidavit as a whole and the affidavit of Mr. Dang, I am satisfied that in paragraph 14 of his affidavit the Chairman has set out all the material circumstances which bad emerged on an examination of the various materials before him.\\nBriefly put, those circumstances are delay, bungling and faulty planning by the management resulting in double expenditure, huge losses, sharp fall in the price of the Company 's shares and the resignation of some of the directors on account of differences in opinion with 343 the managing director.\\nI think that these circumstances, without more, cannot reasonably suggest that the business of the company was being conducted to defraud the creditors, members and other persons or that the management was guilty of fraud towards the company and its members.\\nNo reasonable person who had given proper consideration to these circumstances could have formed the opinion that they suggested any fraud as mentioned in the order dated May 19, 1965.\\nHad the Chairman applied his mind to the relevant facts, he could not have formed this opinion.\\nI am, there fore, inclined to think that he formed the opinion without applying his mind to the facts.\\nAn opinion so formed by him is in excess of his powers and cannot support an order under section 237(b).\\nThe appeal is allowed, and the impugned order is set aside.\\nI concur in the order which Shelat, J. proposes to pass.\\nShelat J.\\nThe appellant company is a public limited company registered on July 28, 1961 having its registered office at Ramavaram in Andhra Pradesh and the second appellant was at all material times and is still its managing director.\\nOn August 25, 1959 and September 23, 1960 appellant No. 2 obtained two licences for the manufacture of 2500 and 1900 tonnes of barium chemicals per year in the name of Transworld Traders of which lie was the proprietor.\\nHe then started negotiations with Kali Cliemle of Hannover, West Germany to collaborate with him in setting up a plant.\\nWhile he was so negotiating, M/s., ,T. T. Krishnamachari & Co., who were the sole selling agents of the said German Company, approached the 2nd appellant for the sole selling agency of barium products of the plant proposed to be put up by the 2nd appellant.\\nThe 2nd appellant did not agree.\\nOn December 5, 1960 M/s. T. T. K. & Co., applied for a licence for manufacture of barium chemicals.\\nOn December 23, 1960 the 2nd appellant wrote a letter to the Minister of Commerce and Industry objecting to the grant of a licence to M/s. T. T. K. & Co. Both were considered by the Licensing Committee.\\nThe Committee rejected the application of M/s. T. T. K. & Co., but advised them to apply again after six months.\\nOn a representation by M / section T. T. K. &.Co., the Committee reconsidered the matter and recommended the grant of licence to M/s. T. T. K. Chemicals Private Limited.\\nThe second appellant once more protested, this time to the Prime Minister but that was rejected.\\nOn July 28, 1961.\\nan agreement between the appellant company and L.A. Mitchell Ltd., of Manchester was signed where under the latter agreed to put up the plant on the appellant company agreeing to pay them pound 184,500.\\nOn November 27, 1961, the Government granted a licence to the company for the import of machinery.\\n, In the mean time, respondent No. 2 was appointed a, Minister without portfolio and rejoined the Cabinet which lie had left ' earlier owing to certain circumstances which are not relevant for the present.\\nFrom January, 1962 to March, 1963, he continued as a L/S5SCI 24 344 Minister without portfolio but from March, 1963 to September, 1963, he became the Minister for Defence and Economic Co ordination and thereafter the Finance Minister.\\nOn August 30, 1962, the licence granted to M / section T. T. K. Chemicals Ltd. was revoked as the company had decided to surrender it.\\nIt would seem that the appellant company was not faring as well as was hoped and though it had been incorporated as early as July, 1961 production had not commenced.\\nThere arose also disputes among its directors.\\nOn May 30, 1964 and July 9, 1964 four of its directors submitted two memoranda alleging irregularities and even illegalities in the conduct of the company 's affairs to the Company Law Board.\\nAccording to the second appellant, the four directors were disgruntled directors, hostile to him and the Company.\\nThe company was not able to start work in full capacity not because of any irregularities but because of the faulty planning and designing by the collaborators.\\nThe company realised this fact only in June, 1964 when it received a survey report after the breakdown of the plant during that month from M/s. Humphreys and Glascow (Overseas) Ltd., Bombay.\\nIn September, 1964, a meeting was affanged in London between the company 's representatives and the representatives of L.A. Mitchell Ltd., of which Lord Poole was the Chairman.\\nIt was agreed that L. A. Mitchell Ltd., should depute M/s. Humphreys and Glascow Ltd., London,to go through the designs etc., and to make a report showing the causes of the repeated failures of the plant and suggesting remedies there for.\\nLord Poole also agreed that the factory would be commissioned without any further delay and that L.A. Mitchell Ltd., would carry out the necessary repairs at their cost.\\nWhile these negotiations were going on, representatives of M/s. Kali Chemie of Hannover arrived in India to negotiate a collaboration agreement with the company.\\nOn April 4, 1965, a meeting of the company 's directors was held in New Delhi which was attended by one Kriegstein, a representative of Kali Chemie and also by the General Manager of M/s. T. T. K. & Co. Certain proposals were discussed and it was decided that the company should give notice to L. A. Mitchell Ltd. canceling the agreement with them.\\nAccordingly, by a notice dated April 2. 1965 the agreement with the said L. A. Mitchell Ltd., was cancelled.\\nOn May 7, 1965 representatives of the appellant company and of Kali Chemie met at Stuttgart when proposals for an agreement were discussed.\\nOne of these proposals was that the company should be reorganised and its share capital should be distributed in the following proportions: 49 per cent to the appellant company, 26 per cent to Kali Chemie and 25 per cent to M/s. T. T. K. & Co. It was also proposed that Kali Chemie should take over the responsibility on the production side, the appellant company would be responsible for the management and M/s. T.T.K. & Co. should take over sales promotion.\\nBefore however these negotiations could take concrete shape, Lord Poole came over to India.\\nA meet ing was held on May 10, 1965 between him and the directors of the 345 appellant company.\\nLord Poole agreed that the British company would put in pound 250,000 in addition to the amount already invested by it and that production would commence from June, 1965.\\nOn May It 1965 another meeting took place when it was decided that without prejudice to what was stated in the notice of April 4, 1965, the appellant company should withdraw para 9 thereof whereby the agreement between them was terminated.\\nBy May 11, 1965, the position therefore was that the collaboration agreement between the company and L. A. Mitchell Ltd. was agreed to be continued and consequently the negotiations with the German company and M/s. T. T. K. & Co., were not to proceed further.\\nOn May 19 1965 the first respondent passed the impugned order which inter alia stated: \\\"In the opinion of the Company Law Board there are circumstances suggesting that the business of M/s Barium Chemicals Ltd is being conducted with intent to defraud its creditors, members and other persons; and further that the persons concerned in the management of the affairs of the company have in connection therewith been guilty of fraud, misfeasance and other misconduct towards the company and its members. [/INST] The Company Law Board was constituted under Section 10E of the , and the Central Government delegated some of its powers under the Act, including those under Section 237, to the Board.\\nThe Government also framed rules under Section 642(1) read with Section 10E(5) called the Company Law Board (Procedure) Rules 1964, Rule 3 of which empowered the Chairman of the Board to distribute the business of the Board among himself and other member or members and to specify the cases or classes of cases which were to be considered jointly by the Board.\\nOn February 6, 1954, under the power vested in him by Rule 3 the Chairman passed an order specifying the cases that had to be considered jointly by himself and the only other member of the Board and distributing the remaining business between himself and the member.\\nUnder this order the business of ordering investigations under Sections 235 and 237 was allotted to himself to be performed by him singly.\\nOn May 19, 1965 an order was issued on behalf of the Company Law Board under Section 237(b) of the .\\nappointing four inspectors to investigate the affairs of the appellant company, on the ground that the Board was of the opinion that there were circumstances suggesting that the business of the appellant company was being conducted with intent to defraud its creditors, members or any other persons and that the persons concerned in the management of the affairs of the company had in connection therewith been guilty of fraud, misfeasence and other misconduct towards the company and its members.\\nSoon afterwards the appellants filed a petition under article 226 of the Constitution for the issue of a writ quashing the order of the Board on the grounds, inter alia, that the order had been issued mala fide that there was no material on which such an order could have been made, etc.\\nOne of the affidavits filed in reply to the petition was by the ,Chairman of the Company Law Board, in which it was contended, inter alia, that there was material on the basis of which the impugned order was issued and he had himself examined this material and formed the necessary opinion within the meaning of sec.\\n237(b) before the issue of the order; and that it was not competent for the court to go into the question of the adequacy or otherwise of such material.\\nIn the course of replying to some of the allegations in the petition it was stated in paragraph 14 of the affidavit, however, that from memoranda received from some ex directors of the company and other examination it appeared, inter alia, that there had been delay, bungling and faulty planning of the company 's main project ,resulting in double expenditure; that the company had incurred huge losses; there had been a sharp fall in the price of the company 's SCI 22 312 shares; and some eminent persons had resigned from the Board of Directors of the company because of differences with the Managing Director on account of the manner in which the affairs of the company were being conducted.\\nThe appellant 's petition was dismissed by the High Court.\\nIn the appeal to this Court it was contended on behalf of the appellants: (1) That the order was made made fide on account of the competing interests of a firm in which the Minister in charge of the department was interested and also because of his personal hostility against the second petitioner who was the managing director of the company; that the High Court had erred in deciding the petition on the footing that the first respondent Board was an independent authority and that it was its Chairman who on his own had formed the requisite opinion and passed the order and therefore the motive or the evil eye of the Minister was irrelevant; the High Court also erred in failing to appreciate that even though the impugned order was by the Chairman, as under section 10E(6) it had to receive and in fact received the Minister 's agreement, if the Minister 's mala fides were established, that would vitiate the order; furthermore, in the circumstances of the case.\\nthe High Court ought to have allowed the appellants an opportunity to establish their case of mala fide by the cross examination of the Minister and the Chairman, both of whom had filed affidavits.\\n(2) That clause (b) of Section 237 required two things: (i) the requisite opinion of the Central Government, in the present case, of the Board, and (ii) the existence of circumstances suggesting that the company 's business was being conducted as laid down in sub clause (i) or that the persons mentioned in sub clause (ii) were guilty of fraud, misfeasance or misconduct towards the company or any of its members; though the opinion to be formed is subjective, the existence of circumstances set out in cl.\\n(b) is a condition precedent to the formation of such opinion and therefore even if the impugned order were to contain a recital of the existence of those circumstances, the court can go behind that recital and determine whether they did in fact exist, that even taking the circumstances said to have been found by the respondent Board, they were extraneous to see.\\n237(b) and could not constitute a basis for the impugned order.\\n(3) That the impugned order was in fact made on the basis of allegations contained in memoranda submitted by four ex directors of the company who continued to be shareholders; and by ordering an investigation under section 237(b) the respondent Board had in effect enabled these shareholders to circumvent the provisions of section 235 and section 236.\\nOn this ground also the impugned order was therefore made mala fide or was otherwise invalid.\\n(4) That the impugned order was in any case bad as it was passed by the Chairman of the Respondent Board alone acting under rules under which such a power was conferred in contravention of the provisions of Section 10E.\\nThe power under section 237 was delegated by the Central Government to the Board as a whole and could not in turn be sub delegated to the Chairman alone in the absence of a provision such as sub sec.\\n(4A) added to sec.\\n10E after the impugned order was issued, and which now enabled the solidarity of the Board to be broken.\\nSuch sub delegation could not be done in accordance with rules made under section 10E(5) which merely enabled the procedure of the Board to be regulated.\\n313 (5) That the impugned order was bad because Section 237(b) itself was bad as offending against articles 14 and 19 of the Constitution.\\nHELD: (By Hidayatullah.\\nBachawat and Shelat, JJ., Sarkar C.J. and Mudholkar J. dissenting): The impugned order must be set aside.\\n(1) (By the Court): The respondents had failed to show that the impugned order was passed mala fide.\\nL330 E; 335 B C; F G].\\n(Per Sarkar C.J. and Mudholkar J.3: The decision to order the investigation was taken by the Chairman of the respondent Board and there was nothing to indicate that in arriving at that decision he was influenced by the Minister.\\nIf the decision arrived at by the Chairman was an independent one, it could not be said to have been rendered mala fide because it was later approved by the Minister.\\n[320 D].\\nIn a proceeding under article 226 of the Constitution, the normal rule is, as pointed out by this Court in The State of Bombay vs Purshottam Jog Naik ; , to decide disputed questions on the basis of affidavits and that it is within the discretion of the High Court whether to allow a person who has sworn an affidavit before it to be cross examined or not.\\nThe High Court having refused permission for the cross examination, it would not be appropriate for this Court, while hearing an appeal.\\nby special leave, to interfere lightly with the exercise of its discretion.\\n[320 G H; 321 A].\\n(Per Shelat J.): The allegations of mala fides in the petition were not grounded on any knowledge but only on \\\"reasons to believe\\\".\\nEven for their reasons to believe, the appellants had not disclosed any information on which they were founded.\\nNo particulars of the main allegations were given.\\nAlthough in a case of this kind it would be difficult for a petitioner to have personal knowledge in regard to an averment of mala fides, where such knowledge is wanting, he must disclose his source of information so that the other side gets a fair chance to verify it and make an effective answer.\\nIn the absence of tangible materials, the only answer which the respondents could array against the allegations as to mala fides would be one of general denial.\\n[352 D H].\\nIn a petition under article 226, there is undoubtedly ample power in the High Court to order attendance of a deponent in court for being cross examined.\\nWhere it is not possible for the court to arrive at a definite conclusion on account of there being affidavits on either side containing allegations and counter allegations, it would not only be desirable but in the interest of justice the duty also of the court to summon a deponent for cross examination in order to arrive at the truth.\\nHowever, the High Court was rightly of the view that in the present case even if the two deponents were to be called for cross examination, they could in the absence of particulars of allegations of mala fides and the other circumstances of the case, only repeat their denials in the affidavits of the allegations in the petition and therefore such cross examination would not take the court any further than the affidavits.\\n[353 D H].\\n(2) (Per Hidayatullah, Bachawat and Shelat JJ.\\nSarkar, C. J. and Mudholkar J. dissenting,):The circumstances disclosed in paragraph 14 of the affidavit must be regarded as the only materials on the basis of which the respondent Board formed the opinion before ordering an investigation under Section 237(b).\\nThese circumstances could not reasonably suggest that the business of the company was being conducted to defraud the creditors, members or other L/S5SCI 22(a) 314 persons or that the management was guilty of fraud towards the company and its members; they were therefore, extraneous to the matters mentioned in section 237(b) and the impugned order was ultra vires the Section.\\n[339 A D, G H; 340 A; 342 G H; 343 AC; 365 D E; 367 A C].\\n(Per Hidayatullah J.): The power under Section 237(b) in a discretionary power and the first requirement for its exercise is the 'honest formation of an opinion that an investigation is necessary.\\n,The next requirement is that \\\"there are circumstances suggesting\\\" the inferences stout in the Section.\\nAn action, not based on circumstances suggesting an inference of the enumerated kind will not be valid.\\nNo doubt the formation of opinion is subjective but the existence of circumstances relevant to the inference as the sine qua non for action must be demonstrable.\\nIf their existence is questioned, it has to be proved at least prima facie.\\nIt is not sufficient to assert, that the circumstances exist and give no clue to what they are, because the circumstances must be such as to lead to conclusions of certain definiteness.\\nThe conclusions must relate to an intent to defraud, a :fraudulent or unlawful purpose, fraud or misconduct or the withholding of information of a particular kind.\\n[335 F H; 336 G H] An examination of the affidavit filed by the Chairman of the respondent Board showed that the material examined by the Chairman merely indicated the need for a deeper probe.\\nThis was not sufficient.\\nThe material must suggest certain inferences and not the need for \\\"a deeper probe\\\".\\nThe former is a definite conclusion the 'latter a mere fishing expedition.\\n[338 E H].\\n(Per Shelat J.): Althouugh the formation of opinion by cen tral Government is a purely subjective process and such an opinion cannot be challenged in a court on the ground of propriety, reasonableness or sufficiency, the Authority concerned is nevertheless required to arrive at such an opinion from circumstances suggesting what is set out in sub clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of section 237 (b).\\nThe expres sion \\\"circumstances suggesting\\\" cannot support the construction that even the existence of circumstances is a matter of subjective opinion.\\nIt is hard to contemplate that the legislature could have left to the subjective process both the formation of opinion and also the existence of circumstances on which it is to be founded.\\nIt is also not reasonable to say that the clause permitted the Authority to say that it has formed the opinion on 'circumstances which in its opinion exist and which in its opinion suggest an intent to defraud or a fraudulent or unlawful purpose.\\nIf it is shown that the circumstances do not exist or that they are such that it is impossible for any one to form an opinion therefrom suggestive of the matters enumerated in section 237 (b) the opinion is challengeable on the ground 'of non application of mind or perversity or on the ground that it was formed on collateral grounds and was beyond the scope of the statute.\\n[362 H; 363 A G].\\n(Per Sarkar C.J., and Mudholkar J. dissenting): An examina tion of section 237 would show that cl.\\n(b) thereof confers a discretion upon the 'Board to appoint an Inspector to investigate the affairs of a company.\\nThe words \\\"in the opinion of\\\" govern the word \\\"there are circumstances suggesting\\\" and not the words \\\"may do so\\\".\\nThe words 'circumstances ' and 'suggesting ' cannot be dissociated without making it impossible for the Board to form an 'opinion ' at all.\\nThe formation of an opinion must, 'therefore, be as to whether there are circumstances suggesting the existence of one or more of 'the matters in sub cls.\\n(i) to (iii) and not about anything else.\\nThe opinion must of course not have been arrived at mala fide.\\nTo say that the, opinion to be formed must be as to the necessity 315 of making an investigation would be making a clear departure from the language in which section 237(b) is couched.\\nIt is only after the formation of certain opinion by the Board that the stage for exercising the discretion conferred by the provision is reached.\\nThe discretion conferred to order an investigation is administrative and not judicial since its exercise one way or the other does not affect the rights of a company nor does it lead to any serious consequences as, for instance, hampering the business of the company.\\nAs has been pointed out by this Court in Raja Narayanalal Bansilal vs Maneck Phiroz Mistry and Anr. , the investigation undertaken under this provision is for ascertaining facts and is thus merely exploratory.\\nThe scope for judicial review of the action of the Board must, therefore be strictly limited.\\nIf it can be shown that the Board had in fact not formed an opinion its order could be successfully challenged.\\nThere is a difference between not forming an opinion at all and forming an opinion upon grounds, which, if a court could go into that question at all, could be regarded as inapt or insufficient or irrelevant.\\nThe circumstances set out in paragraph 14 of the affidavit of the Chairman of the respondent Board were nothing more than certain conclusions drawn by the Board from some of the material which it had before it.\\nMoreover, the expression \\\"inter alia\\\" used by the Chairman would show that the conclusions set out by him specifically were not the only ones which could be drawn from the material before the Board.\\nIt would not therefore be right to construe the affidavit to mean that the only conclusions emerging from the material before the Board were those set out in paragraph 14.\\n[352 A E].\\n(3) (Per Sarkar C. J. and Mudholkar J.): As it could not be said that the investigation had been ordered either at the instance of 4 ex directors of the company or on the sole basis of the memoranda submitted by them, there was no contravention of the provisions of Sections 235 and 236 of the Act.\\n[328 C, E].\\n(4) (Per Sarkar C. J., Mudholkar and Bachawat JJ.\\n, Hidayatullah and Shelat JJ., dissenting): Rule 3 of the Company Law Board (Procedure) Rules, 1964, and the order dated April 6, 1964 made pursuant thereto distributing the business of the Board, were both valid.\\nThe impugned order was not therefore invalid because it was made by the Chairman alone and not by the Board.\\n[330 C. D; 342 B C].\\n(Per Sarkar C.J. and Mudholkar J.): Bearing in mind the fact that the power conferred by Section 237(b) is merely administrative, the allocation of the business of the Board relating to the exercise of such power must be regarded as a matter of procedure.\\nStrictly speaking the Chairman to whom the business of the Board is allocated does not become a delegate of the Board at all.\\nHe acts in the name of the Board and is no more than its agent.\\nBut even if he is looked upon as a delegate of the Board and, therefore, sub delegate vis avis the Central Government, he would be as much subject to the control of the Central Government as the Board itself, for sub section\\n(6) of section 10E provides that the Board shall, in the exercise of the powers delegated to it, be subject to the control of the Central Government and the order distributing the business was made with permission of the Central Government.\\nBearing in mind that the maxim delegates non protest delegable sets out what is merely a rule of construction, subdelegation can be sustained if permitted by an express provision or by necessary implication.\\nWhere, as here, what is sub delegated is an administrative power and control over its exercise is retained by the nominee of Parliament, that is, here the Central Government, the power to make a delegation may be inferred, [329 F H; 330 A C].\\n316 (Per Bachwat J.): The function under section 237(b) involves the exercise of a discretion.\\nPrima facie all the members of the Board acting together were required to discharge this function and they could not delegate their duty to the Chairman.\\nHowever, under sections 10E(5) and 642(1), the Central Government may frame rules regulating the procedure of the Board and generally to carry out the purpose of the Act.\\nIn the context of section 10E, the rule making power should be construed liberally.\\nThe Central Government has power to constitute the Company Law Board, to delegate its function to the Board and to control the Board in the exercise of its delegated functions.\\nIn this background, by conferring on the Central Government the additional power of framing rules regulating the procedure of the Board and generally to carry out the purposes of section 10E Parliament must have intended that the internal Organisation of the Board and the mode and manner of transacting its business should be regulated entirely by rules framed by the Government.\\nThe Government had, therefore, power to frame the Company Law Board (Procedure) Rules.\\n1964 authorising the Chairman to distribute the business of the Board.\\nIn the exercise of the power conferred by this rule, the Chairman assioned the business under section 237 to himself.\\nThe Chairman alone could, therefore, pass the impugned order.\\n[341 F H; 342 A C].\\n(Per Hidayatullah J.): The new sub section 4A of Section 10E, which was not there when the impugned order was made.\\nenables the work of the Board to be distributed among members, while sub section\\n(5) merely enables the procedure of the Board to be regulated.\\nThese are two very different things.\\nOne provides for distribution of work in such a way that each constituent part of the Board, properly autho rised.\\nbecomes the Board.\\nThe other provides for the procedure of the Board.\\nWhat is the Board is not a question which admits of solution by procedural rules but by the enactment of a substantive provision allowing for a different delegation.\\nSuch an enactment has been framed in relation to the Tribunal constituted under section 10B and has now been framed under section 10E also.\\nThe new sub section involves a delegation of the powers of the Central Government to a member of the Board which the Act previously allowed to be made to the Board only.\\nThe statute, as it was formerly, gave no authority to delegate if differently or to another person or persons.\\nWhen it spoke of procedure in sub section (5) it spoke of the procedure of the Board As constitlited.\\nThe lacuna in the Act must have felt; otherwise there was no need to enact sub section (4A), [334 B E].\\n(Per Shelat T.): The statute having permitted the delegation of powers to the Board only as the statutory Authority the powers so delegated have to be exercised by the Board and not by its components.\\nTo authorise its Chairman to hand over those functions and powers to the.\\nBoard only as the statutory Authority, the powers so by the Act.\\nThe effect of r. 3 and the order of distribution of work made in pursuance thereof was not laying down a procedure but au thorising and, making a sub delegation in favour of the members.\\nThe only procedure which the Government could prescribe was the procedure in relation to Board the manner in which it should discharge and exercise the functions and Powers delegated to it, but it could not make a provision which under the cloak of procedure authorised sub delegation.\\n[369 F H; 370 A, B].\\n(5) (By the Court): The provisions of Section 237(b) were not violative of Articles 14 and 19 of the Constitution.\\n[328 F G; 342 D F; 371 H].\\nSections 234, 235, 236 and 237(b) gave power to different authorities i.e. the Registrar and the Government, provided powers which 317 are different in extent and nature, exercisable in sets of circumstances and in a manner different from one another.\\nTherefore, there is no question of discriminatory power having been vested in the Government under these Sections to pick and choose between (one company and the other.\\n[370 G, H].\\nWhen investigation is ordered, there would be inconvenience in the carrying on of the business of the company.\\nIt might also perhaps shake the credit of a company.\\nBut an investigation directed under section 237(b) is essentially of an exploratory character and it is not as if any restriction is placed on the right of the concerned company to carry on its business and no restrictions are imposed on those who carry on the company 's affairs.\\nEven if it is regarded as a restriction, it is not possible to say that it is not protected as a reasonable restriction under Clause 6 of article 19(1).\\n[371 B D].\\nCase law referred to. </s>\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
